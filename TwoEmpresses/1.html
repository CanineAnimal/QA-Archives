So obvious, and so much heat involved, that for thirty seconds the launch sequences in all nuclear submarines were initiated pending further approval. A flash report was in the news within a further thirty seconds, explaining that there had been an explosion at the Arbeit Nuclear Power Plant, advising the general evacuation and announcing that an Ausitorian carrier group would proceed to the area to provide further assistance.<br><br>Even <a href="http://www.nationstates.net/page=compare/nations=libraria_and_ausitoria+asasia?censusid=13" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">without the interception of an interesting message</a> - unfortunately the words 'DEMAG' meant nothing - the Ministry of Intelligence and Statistics would have been suspicious. Everything seemed to be blowing up, and the first order of the day was to decode DEMAG, which meant an awfully large number of Ausitorian civil servants were suddenly playing around with words trying to crack it.

<div class="content">Act I<br>Chapter XVII<br><span style="font-weight: bold">The Sea of Ghant</span><br><br>Kukavanger saw the whole thing. He was standing on the deck of his flag ship, Might of the West (if one could call that), staring out into the sea. It was a gunboat, but it was the pride of Kukavanger's ragtag offerings. The Sea of Ghant had been calm for most of the day, but it had begun to get rougher as the day drew on. Kukavanger was a physically imposing man- seven feet tall, and powerfully built- but old. He was 60 years old, with short, curly black hair with hints of grey, a wrinkly weathered face, and pale grey eyes. He had also grown fat with age. The only thing that made him anything special was that he was Kukavanger of the House Vangalesh, Lord of Ice, Lord Paramount of Greycoast, and Warden of Western Ghant. He had many modest ships to his name, and a few good men eager to prove their mettle in their Emperor's pursuit of his Regalian throne.<br><br>As he stared out into the sea- he heard his men shouting at him, and then he heard the noise. He looked up and to the west. He never seen anything like what he saw at that moment. A commercial airliner breaking apart in the sky, falling into the sea. <span style="font-style: italic">Now there is something that you don't see everyday </span>, Kukavanger thought. <span style="font-style: italic">Another prize for the God of the Sea of Ghant.</span> He stood still, and stared in awe at the event unfolding right before his eyes.<br><br>Once the plane and the corresponding debris was in the water and out of sight, Kukavanger walked at a brisk pace to the ship's bridge, and approached the navigator and pilot of the ship. "We need to go that way", he said, pointing in the direction of the crash site.<br><br>The navigator was the first to respond, "That is west, that is away from the rest of the fleet. We all already well enough behind the rest of the fleet."<br><br>Kukavanger grunted. "I don't care about that right now. Did you see that? A commercial plane crashed. There might be survivors. We must look for some."<br><br>The pilot responded, "The day is growing old, and the Sea is growing rough once more. Anyone fortunate enough to have survived that crash will be dead soon enough anyway. There is no way we would find anyone alive in that!"<br><br>Suddenly, one of Kukavanger's lieutenant entered the bridge. "I have urgent news, my lord." The plane was from Mizrad. Mizradian agents were aboard who intend on having an audience with the Emperor. We have reason to believe that they are out there, and alive! The Emperor bids us go and retrieve them, seeing as how we are the closest to the crash site. And we must act in haste- we are not to only ones in search of 'survivors'".<br><br>"Who else is looking for them?" Kukavanger said.<br><br>"The Librarians and the Imperial Fleet", replied the lieutenant.<br><br>Just then, a message had been received. "Ahoy Might of the West, This is Ausitorian Flying Captain Sir Edward Jenkins; we have spotted a Wing in the water and are dropping flares over it. We think we can see bodies hanging onto it. Our helicopters are still nearly half an hour away, so we cannot undertake a rescue operation ourselves. Could you please proceed and investigate?"<br><br>Kukavanger send his response. "We are on it, Captain Jenkins. Thank you for the heads-up."<br><br>"You see, fools?" Kukavanger said to the pilot and navigator. "I know best. Now lets go before it gets dark out, and find them before these others do."<br><br>Might of the West turned in a westward direction. Kukavanger ordered many of his men to come to the deck of the ship with binoculars and flashlights. He also had some technicians patch up the search lights, which had fallen into disrepair. Kukavanger himself stood at the nose of the ship. "Keep your eyes open for men in the water! This is on the Emperor's business!"<br><br>As it started to get dark out, one man was found floating face-up in the water. He was not moving. One of Kukavanger's men spotted him, and the men on deck began shouting.<br><br>"Pull him up", Kukavanger shouted.<br><br>"He looks dead", one man replied.<br><br>"I don't give a shit. Pull him up, now."<br><br>Four men grabbed a large rope-net and threw it into the water. They caught the man in the rope-net as the ship passed by. They hauled him up.<br><br>"Take him to the infirmary. We will see to him later." the four men gathered the man up and took him below deck.<br><br>They found nothing besides the unconscious man for the next ten minutes, and it began to grow dark out, and the Sea began to grow violent. It didn't seem like they would find anything else...<br><br>A man shouted on deck, "flares!"<br><br>Kukavanger looked in that direction, and saw them as well. "Ah, and there they must be!", he signaled the bridge to turn in the direction of the flares.<br><br>After a time, evening turned to dark, they found the wing of the plane that had crashed earlier. Kukavanger ordered men to point the search lights and flashlights at the wreckage. Hanging on the wing were 4 men, who had looked like they had seen better days. <span style="font-style: italic">The Sea of Ghant has worked these fellows it would seem. They are lucky we found them when we did</span>. As the ship approached the wing, Kukavanger ordered that nets be made ready. It began to rain, and the waves grew in strength. If he shouted at the four men in the water, chances are they would not hear.<br><br>As the ship pulled up alongside the wreckage, the rope-nets were thrown over and into the water. Kukavanger beckoned the four men to come with his hands, and the men were scooped up into the nets, and hauled up.<br><br>Once the men were on deck, Kukavanger introduced himself. "Hello men. I am Kukavanger, Lord of Ice in Ghant. Welcome aboard my ship! I have warm food, beds and warm clothes for you." He spoke the Grey-dialect of Ghantish, which was the hardest to understand for a non-Ghantish speaker. They didn't seem to understand. There were no men among Kukavanger's crew that spoke Mizradian.<br><br>Kukavanger beckoned the men come with him, and they followed. He took them to his cabin- and extended his hand out towards the beds, the food on the table, and to the clean clothes and blankets layed out for them. <span style="font-style: italic">Let it be known that I am a man of great hospitality, </span> Kukavanger thought to himself. He waved to the four men and left them in his cabin. He went straight to the bridge. He found his captain there. "Tell the Emperor that I found his Mizradian friends", he told the captain.<br><br>The captain responded. "My Lord, I have Admiral Sissinick on the line. The Ghantish Coast Guard is nearby, investigating the sea, and he wants to speak with you."<br><br>Kukavanger went to the phone, and picked it up. "Hello Admiral."<br><br>"Kukavanger, how are things going tonight?" The Admiral replied.<br><br>"...Well enough, I suppose. What do you need?"<br><br>"We wanted to know if you found anything out there in the water today."<br><br>"We didn't find anything."<br><br>"I thought you might say something like that. We saw men with parachutes. Did you happen to see anything like that?"<br><br>"I cannot say that I have, Admiral."<br><br>"Uh-huh. Perhaps, if it is alright with you, maybe we can come aboard and take a look around?"<br><br>"Thank you for the offer, Admiral, but I will have to pass."<br><br>"Alright iceman, lets cut the shit and get straight to the point. This is a matter of national security. We have intel that suggested that there were Mizradian agents en route to the Emperor's fleet, and meant to rendezvous with the Emperor and Empress. The Prime Minister of Ghant demands these agents. And I think you have them. Why don't you just hand them over, since the Ghantish Government seems to want them badly enough to send the Coast Guard and the Imperial Fleet out here to retrieve them?"<br><br>"Tell the Prime Minister he can kiss my fat white ass. I know my rights. I am a private citizen on my own boat, in international water, minding my own business, and I am under the Emperor's protection. I don't want you Imperials coming on my ship and snooping around my stuff. So why don't you go back to Bargon and leave me the hell alone? Unless you want to start an incident with the Emperor by screwing around with my ship, then by all means lets get on with it."<br><br>"Alright, smartass. Thank you for your cooperation, and have a nice night." Admiral Sissinick hung up the phone.<br><br>Kukavanger then called the Librarians. "We checked out the wing, but we did not find anything. Those 'bodies' that you were referring to ended up being debris. No survivors, as far as we could tell.<br><br>Kukavanger looked at the captain. "Contact the Emperor." He turned to the pilot. "Set a course for the south, and lets catch up with the Green Treader."<br><br>Within a few minutes, the captain said, "Alright, my lord. The Emperor has been contacted and is aware that we have the Mizradians. We should reach the Green Treader in about 2 hours.<br><br>"Good." Kukavanger said, and then he left the bridge and went back to the deck of the ship.<br><br>The rain began to grow heavy, and the waves were rough. The Sea of Ghant was always rougher at night. He watched the waves rock the ship, and felt the sea and wind upon his face. Kukavanger had only left Ghant once, and that was during the first Rhodo-Eprarian War. Even though the war began in 1971, Ghant only got involved in 1975. That was Kukavanger was there. He thought of the bombs, the fire, the dying screams of men...<br><br>Kukavanger had lost track of time, and before he knew it, they were upon the Green Treader. He went back to the bridge. "The Emperor is one line, my lord", stated the captain. Kukavanger picked up the phone. "Your majesty, we have the Mizradians. What should I do with them."<br><br>"Come now, Kuka, just call me Nathan. The Mizradians must be pretty beat up. See that they are well rested and are warm. We shall continue on our course to Gillenor. The Mizradians may join me on the Green Treader when they are ready and able to. Until then, the Green Treader shall remain close, for when that time comes."<br><br>"As you wish, Nathan". The Emperor hung up. Kukavanger decided to go down and check on his guests.</div>

<div class="content">OOC: Ghant, I said my fighters would be in the area within 15 minutes, and they would certainly have noticed a great big wing within a few minutes. They would also have notified you of its whereabouts, and therefore it would take you less than half an hour to find those men. I wonder if you could please edit your post to incorporate the events described here? IC:<br><br>The Ghantish ships that pirouetted and preyed in search of the survivors were observed from the air by arriving Ausitorian fighters - the sort of largish one or two engined fighters that the Ausitorians tended to protect their carriers with. By virtue of their cameras, and teams of analysts in Alexandria, it took only one-hundred-and-twenty seconds to observe a great big wing, and only a further ten seconds for the rescue to be arranged.<br><br>"Ahoy <span style="font-style: italic">Might of the West</span>, This is Ausitorian Flying Captain Sir Edward Jenkins; we have spotted a Wing in the water and are dropping flares over it. We think we can see bodies hanging onto it. Our helicopters are still nearly half an hour away, so we cannot undertake a rescue operation ourselves. Could you please proceed and investigate?"<br><br>Flares floated down, exploding at 20 foot intervals, from a hovering aircraft, which, along with the other aircraft, watched the scene closely.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ghant <a href="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=263293&amp;p=16847722#p16847722">wrote</a>:</cite>"We checked out the wing, but we did not find anything. Those 'bodies' that you were referring to ended up being debris. No survivors, as far as we could tell."</div></blockquote><br><br>"Copy that. I could have sworn that those were men that you'd rescued," said the Captain, looking at the camera recordings and knowing perfectly well that <span style="font-style: italic">Might of the West</span> had rescued someone - even if they were totally unprepared to admit it. <br><br>The Foreign Office dispatched a prepared message to Mizrad.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">To: President Ryan West, The Republic of Mizrad<br>From: The Foreign Policy Private Office, The Imperial Commonwealth of Libraria and Ausitoria<br><br>Dear Sirs/Madams,<br><br>We have evidence that some of your special forces have just been picked up from the wing of the crashed airliner.

<div class="content">OOC: Libraria, it's surprisingly only uncommon that crashes like the one I described will have no survivors. For example, maybe one or two people will have survived in the forward section of the plane.

Some of them still with their hair a tad wet. Turner's especially, all he had done in the time they were given to rest was watch the door to his team's cabin in case somebody else wanted to get their hands on them. With so much involvement in the western hemisphere of the world, John had begun to learn Ghish. Although he only knew very little and it most likely wouldn't help his situation. Luckily, with Mizradian being a mix of English and Russian and rarely ever used, he spoke all three of those languages along with Spanish. Hopefully somebody on board the Emperor's fleet would understand one of those languages. <br><br>Knowing his mission time was crucial, he brushes his hair up a bit and straightens out his now dry clothing and gear. One P226, a Zippo, a Ka-Bar and his black cargo pants with black combat boots and a leather jacket. Standing up and walking over to the side of Martin's bed, he begins talking with him.<br>"Do you think you'll be able to continue on with the rest of us?"<br>With a weak voice growing in strength by the seconds passing, Martin responds. <br>"I'm pretty sure I'll be able to, I'm just worried about the fact we're almost definitely being tracked by multiple different factions. That, and if we're caught with what looks like us siding with the Emperor, or anybody for that matter we might just get ourselves caught in the middle of a Ghantish civil war."<br>Turner frowns a bit before rising from his chair and extending a hand to Martin for him to get up.<br>"That's something we don't need to worry about right now. Shall we get moving?"<br><br>With that, the group gets up and exits the room Martin had been placed in as they make their way up to the bridge. Their boots slapping against the catwalks with little cracks and creeks of the metal under them. Knocking on the door to <span style="font-style: italic">Might of the West</span>'s bridge, the five gain entry after speaking with a guard. Arriving inside, Agent Matt Ross is the first to speak up. Luckily, he was fully informed on the dialect of almost every nation in Pannessos. He may not have been great at speaking them all but, there was one phrase he'd never forget for any of them.<br>"Excuse me sir, do you happen to speak English or Russian?"</div>

<div class="content">OOC (apologies, this entire post seems to be a reality check): Clockenstein, do you possess carriers or drones? If so you should have air patrols patrolling at a distance of around 500 km from your fleet. And do you have radar? If so you should really be able to see at least two hundred kilometers. Unless all of your radar is faulty and you are flying without air patrols (in which case heaven help your fleet) you should not be <span style="font-style: italic">surprised</span> to see an enemy fleet on the horizon (a mast the height of 30 m is visible around 100 km away from another mast at a height of 30 m, assuming it's a very clear day).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mizrad <a href="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=263293&amp;p=16849636#p16849636">wrote</a>:</cite>OOC: Libraria, it's surprisingly only uncommon that crashes like the one I described will have no survivors. For example, maybe one or two people will have survived in the forward section of the plane. Oh and sorry for the short post.</div></blockquote><br><br>You said the engines flared and the plane shot up before crashing, which makes it likely that the aircraft crashed into the ocean well in excess of terminal velocity, like Swissair Flight 111. Fire onboard an aircraft is also particularly likely to disrupt all control over the aircraft, so I fear other survivors would be unlikely. But since it's your aircraft, you choose your deaths: if there are other survivors I will be happy to RP continuing the search for them?<br><br>EDIT: And if you're editing your next post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mizrad <a href="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=263293&amp;p=16852372#p16852372">wrote</a>:</cite>First things first though, Libraria I think your reality checks are actually great for this RP.

A poor, depilated country, corrupt and defeated.<br><br>Zhakav lacked the vision and ability to lead Rhodesea into the future. Kruger was a military man, Zhakav was some pansy politician.<br><br>Kruger also had Intel. He had received a letter only 2 weeks ago:<br><br><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>Dear General Kruger,<br><br>I know how much you hate Gillenor, how much you burn for vengeance.

Return Rhodesea to glory now!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Laoni Yousloff</code></dd></dl><br><br>Kruger wasted no time. It was easy for him to convince his comrades to overthrow the socialist regime. The military coup happened quickly. Zhakav had no one to protect him. The Rhodesean military was unified in its desire to rid the country of him. And his government.<br><br>Almost overnight, the Republic of Socialist Rhodesia was no more. And Rhodesia was now ruled by Sarel Kruger himself- as "acting" president. He among the Generals possessed the most respect- he was a seasoned veteran of all o the Rhodo-Eprarian Wars. And he was still physically imposing. He was tall, thin, muscular, with jet black hair, and one hazel eye. He lost his right eye in the First Rhodo-Eprarian War. A black eyepatch covered where his right eye would have been. Some would call him a military dictator. He definitely looked the part. He fancied himself a liberator, however- and a savior.<br><br>The time to act was nigh upon him. A recent nuclear accident in Asasia saw radiation drift into Rhodesea. The negative effects of this occurrence could be somewhat mitigated if the people were distracted. It was time to give them one.<br><br>Downtown Cordia was raining. It was in the early afternoon. In the public square, many had gathered to witness the occasion. Kruger stepped out onto the balcony of the Government Building on the edge of the square. He was wearing his military uniform. Facing the crowd, he spoke:<br><br>"Great people of Rhodesea! Your time has come! Today, we cast down this corrupt and ineffective government! I give you freedom, I give you opportunity, I give you revenge! Welcome to the Republic of Rhodesea! And behold, the scoundrel himself!"<br><br>Anton Zhakav had his hands tied behind his back. He was dressed in rags, and until now had a burlap sack over his head. It was removed and he was pushed out into the middle of the square. He had been badly beaten, and had a blank expression on his face.<br><br>"Witness now, as the fool Zhakav ushers in the new era, with his own blood! We have all bled for the fatherland, now it is his turn!"<br><br>The crowd began to shout for his death. Kruger gave the signal.<br><br>The closet soldier walked up to Zhakav, and shot him point blank in the forehead. The crowd began to roar with approval.<br><br>"Prepare yourselves, Rhodesea. The Golden Age awaits! We shall return the fatherland to greatness! And it begins tonight, when we mobilize our forces! To the world we shall go, and we shall cast all who would seek to oppress us down! And no one will stop us!"<br><br>The crowd began to cheer his name. "Kruger! Kruger! Kruger!"<br><br>He held his hands high and bowed. And then walked back into the Government Building.<br><br>He heard a knock on the door. "Who goes there?"<br><br>"General, we have something that might be of interest to you."<br><br>"You better. Come in."<br><br>Four guards walked into the room with a man in between them. He was dressed in a prison uniform and had a burlap sack over his head.<br><br>"General, we recovered this man in the jungle. He was with pirates who obtained him when they raided a vessel en route to Padonia. We killed the pirates and took him. We thought he might be of interest to you."<br><br>"Take that sack off of his head. I want to know who he is."<br><br>When the sack was removed, Kruger knew who the man was instantly. It had been along time since he had seen that face.<br><br>"Alexander Illyich Bakanski. Welcome to Rhodesea."<br><br>"Fuck you, Rhodesean. You and your kind are nothing but dogs. I have taken so many of your women like dogs, that I have lost count..."<br><br>Kruger walked right up to Bakanski and punched him the face. His nose broke and spattered blood. Kruger then kneed him in the gut, and Bakanski fell to the ground. Kruger then kicked him in the ribs not once, twice, but three times.<br><br>Kruger took a step back. He shouted. "Get him up". The soldiers jerked him back up on his feet. Blood was running down his face.<br><br>"Let me tell you how this is going to work, asshole. You can play along nicely and behave yourself, and act with dignity. Once Loufe knows that you are here, they should cooperate with my plans. And, if they play along and once this is all done, maybe I will send you back to Loufe, footloose and fancy-free. Or, you could be a shithead, in which case I will ship you off to Padonia where you will rot in prison and never see the light of day again."<br><br>Bakanski looked Kruger in the eyes. "And what if I play along, and Loufe doesn't?"<br><br>Kruger laughed. "I thought you might ask a question like that. They want you back, badly. They will do what I want as a result. And if they don't, then I won't hesitate to cut little pieces of you off and sent them to Louveinia in priority mail packages."<br><br>"Fair enough."<br><br>"So, what's it going to be, Bakanski?"<br><br>Bakanski looked around the office for a moment, and then back at Kruger. "I am rather enjoying the weather here in Rhodesea."<br><br>Kruger smiled. "Now you are thinking. Men, remove those shackles and chains." The soldiers freed Bakanski of his restraints.<br><br>"Here." Kruger tossed Bakanski a towel. "Clean yourself up, and come have a drink with me. I have some vintage Rhodesean Red for us to drink."<br><br>Kruger walked over to the sofa and sat down. He reached over to the coffee table and grabbed the bottle of Rhodesean Red. He poured some into two wine glasses that he pulled out of the cabinet. He grabbed one of the glasses and held it up.<br><br>Bakanski held the towel to his face. It was soaked in blood. His nose was broken and would need to be reset. Despite that, he walked over to the other sofa, and sat down across from Kruger. Kruger offered him the other glass. He picked it up with his other hand.<br><br>Kruger spoke. "I would like to propose a toast."<br><br>"A toast to what?"<br><br>Kruger grinned. "To watching the world burn."<br><br>The two men clanked their glasses together and drank.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The End of Act I</span></div>

The Supreme Court, having immediately issued a Warrant for General Krugger's arrest on charges of Murder, Brutality, and High Treason to another nation; found itself in the enviable position of not needing to defend its theory of Extra-jurisdictional Supremac, such was the ire raised against the Rhodesian traitors. <br><br>As the nation debates the best course of the action - suggestions ranging from economic sanction to outright annexation on charges of mis-government - the Foreign Secretary, Duke Palmerston, declared that they would be monitoring the situation very closely and would exhaust peaceable options before rushing into war - a first. Normally open to charges of pushing the nation to the brink of war, this time the Duke appears to be pushing the nation away from war and back towards the brink.<br><br>The Prime Minister, Sir Henry Taylor, has appealed for calm amongst the population and promised that a vote would be held in Parliament before any further actions were taken.

The situation continues to deteriorate as the Emperor of Ghant has set sail for Osserheim, where paramilitary forces are being gathered under the banner of the ancient 'Kingdom of Regalia.' Stadtholder Maria Veldt declared in a statement earlier today that the situation was "extremely worrying."<br>The Stadtholder urged the Ghantish government to take action against the Emperor, declaring him to be a "definite and obvious threat to the peace and security of the Panessian people." The Office of Defence has reportedly authorized the re-organisation of the Second Expeditionary Division, to be prepared to deploy from Osbaai to parts unknown; Stadtholder Veldt acknowledged rumors that the Lowlandian Government was preparing for the worst. "The situation is highly volatile, and not entirely clear," the Stadtholder stated, "and hence we are preparing for every possibility- even the worst."<br><div align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Revolution in Rhodesea</span><br>States-General Bill to Recognize New Government Blocked by Labourer's Party</span></div><br>The Labourer's party has reportedly blocked a States-General resolution to recognize the new 'government' of Rhodesea in accordance with the national policy of 'practical diplomacy' by preventing the Secular-Democrats from gaining the two-thirds majority necessary in the Second House to pass the bill.

We cannot allow ourselves to demonstrate even one iota of support for his brutality and despotism; if this means ceasing to have discourse with Rhodesea, it is a price we are more than willing to pay."<br>Anthon Geverts, leader of the Secular-Democratic party, refused to provide comment when asked, but Josef De Jong, leader of the Witt Party, had this to say; "Evertsen is stuck in the past. We may not like the new r&#233;gimes policies, but they are sovereign and should be recognized as such. The Labourer's party needs to learn how to reconcile their idealism and reality."</blockquote><br><hr><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jAzXyQB.jpg" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Regeringsplein 1,</a> Batavia, Tilpashim, The New Lowlands<br>Three Days Earlier<br>The Oblong Office</span><br>Light poured into the Office, a golden reminder of the setting sun which overlooked the city of Batavia; the wind gently stirred the two flags set at the main entrance to the room, multicolored banners to a background of white.

Said Marcus Redfall of Lushenberg.<br>"While it wouldn't be wise to take military action, we could also still give assistance, we would still maintain a good relationship with everybody!" Said another Union Representative. Useless babble like this happened for several hours, but this argument was going nowhere. Chairman Hedler was very quiet during the argument. Eventually Hedler heard the end of it.<br>"Listen, we have already recognized the new regime in Rhodesea, and we already have good relations with Rhodesea. If they are going to be taking militaristic action in Epraria, so will we! We will be supporting the Blood Ravens and the Rhodeseans for the good of our interests and to preserve theirs! Now all of you shut the Hell up and let's vote!" Many of the Representatives were shocked by this unexpected outburst, but they voted. The voted was for Military action in Epraria. The PUAA was mobilized, and prepared for what was to come next.</div>

Two problems are commonly cited: first, the limited ability of the Central Bank to cope with a sudden fall in FDI, and second, the physical loss of cheap imports, from textiles to toys, which would push up prices for Commonwealth consumers even while the military would absorb the export losses in the petrochemicals and manufactured goods sectors. <br><br>However, Professor Dunkan Smith, a strategy expert at at the Royal Military College, told our reporters that external imbalances was just be the tip of the iceberg. Trade between the distant provinces of our Realms, which has risen by a whopping 470% since the beginning of the year, is particularly vulnerable. "In past wars, the loss of cargo ships was commonplace for a nation at war. However in the modern world we have so few ships carrying so much cargo with such economies of scale that a submarine fleet inside our waters could play absolute havoc to our internal exports and imports. We cannot hope to protect all the routes between our far-flung territories." <br><br>These comments were echoed by the highly-respected Sir Alan Strongarm of The Geostrategy Institute, a private think-tank, who suggested that we ought to be considering becoming more self-sufficient. however, a government spokesperson from the Ministry of Defence, when asked to comment on these matters, replied to these accusations with a strong defence of government policy. "While it is fine to say that we should be self-sufficient, the fact remains that the more developed areas in the Imperial Commonwealth have world-class manufacturers and financial services, and it is much cheaper for other places to make some of the things that we consume. It would be prohibitively expensive and burdensome to try to stop the process of specialization: the free market must be allowed to continue to do what they are best at and so make maximum profits within safety guidelines. In the meantime we are confident in our ability to inflict enough damage against any enemy."<br><br>The Exchequer also released a memo, stating that "It is good to integrate into the world's economy: if we were to rely on the innovations of our own population only, ignoring those of the hundreds of billions of the rest of the world, we would never get on."<br><br>However, despite these assurances, the Stock Market has continued to fall.</div><br><br>Ian Farqahar, Warrant Officer, The United Imperial Commonwealth Air Force, closed his newspaper and yawned. He was bored.<br><br>This was predictable. Although half the country was up in arms over the possibility of war, here, from an altitude of 150,000 feet over international waters, he could read a newspaper without any need to take evasive maneuvers. The computer guidance system was piloting, and he might as well have been a passenger. It was a good aircraft, he thought smugly. Not many 'fighters' did 150,000 feet at a pinch. But then this particular 'fighter' was called the 'Starfighter', and was brand new, using cunning rocket scramjects to provided a limited capacity to head towards space, and was not designed for real fighting, instead being designed to engage satellites in low earth orbit without needing enormous ballistic missiles. <br><br>And it could also look over vast areas below, which was what he was doing: surveillance-snooping in what his lords and masters in the Admiralty assured him was beyond the 24 nautical mile limit of Rhodesea's territorial airspace, practically in low-earth-orbit. And apparently they wouldn't dare shoot: they weren't at war and he had a perfect right to enjoy freedom of navigation. Including apparently the freedom to spy: the Military Intelligence board wanted more data for a more thorough Defence Estimate, so they could adjust their plans - just in case a general war did occur.<br><br>All this meant, Ian reflected, was that he had a pretty boring cruise over this despotic country. Very boring in fact, and he thought longingly of the escapades of his youth, and the incident that had ended it a mere three years previously. In a case of corporate espionage, he had been racing his competitors to speeds of over 200 knots on a fairly busy motorway. This was slightly over the speed limit, and when a police car came barreling down the centre-lane to haul him in, he knew he would either have to flee, or stop, and in doing so surrender the business opportunity. <br><br>He had chosen the former course, evaded the police by slipping across dozens of lanes of traffic between vehicles, had engaged the wing mechanism, and, heading up one of the side-ramps and into the air - forgetting to ask for air-clearance permission - he had resorted to fancy low-flying in the shadow of the valleys. He had lost his pursuers, although not before they had got his vehicle number.<br><br>One successful business mission completed later, he was a million bookmarks the richer, was under arrest, and was hand-picked as an air force pilot. Modern air force flying, they had explained, required people who could think and act at the same time, and if he could evade the air-traffic police he would evidently be more useful working one the side of the law.<br><br>Not that the ability to think and act at the same time appeared to be of any use to him at the present moment, he fancied, as defence analysts poured over a plan to insert a few special forces to kidnap the Rhodesean 'President'.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Teaurnai</span><br><br>Teaurai was a barren wasteland of rock. In fact, the only thing desirable was the marble. Teaurnai was a famed area for its marble. However, the nation was a hegemony, specialising in military force. The Pelnav Agreement had thrown a stick in the annexation of Recardian, planned 5 years before. Now, if they acted, they would have nations from all over the world at their throat. The Hegemonial Covenant decreed that Teaurnai may invade and annex a nation, then eventually have it become part of their country. <br><br>Irestocles Mejkseyos walked down the streets of bustling Saurnai, the Teaurnish flag waving with its huge banner over the Capitol Tower, broadcasting its image to all the populace of the city. It was an average night for him, he was heading to the Jsenakos Varnai nightclub down on Resligheej Zstreet. It was not the highest-quality nightclub, but it was there that terrible event was to begin.<br><br>Irestocles was a covert government agent, determined to annex Recardian through espionage and internal destruction. He was the one who planned the downfall of the entire continent of Hermanius, and all the nations on it. Teaurnai planned to annex not only Recardian, but re-found the Old Taaurnvish Imperium, after it fell when the Kingdom of the Golden Rose marched upon the ancient capital of the realm, Csejkicnai, which was the last holdout before the Empire fell. <br><br>This was even before the Old Empire had arisen, before even the first spark of life in the small village of Hermanium. Before the Bird and Anvil had taken up arms, before the first Krayt emperor even was born. Yes, the Taaurnvish Imperium was <span style="font-style: italic">old</span>. <br><br>And somebody, just a small, unassuming person, planned to ressurect the greatest Empire of all time.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">La Plas&#333; da l&#257;s Peupl&#333;s, Albicant</span><br><br>"Por Victori&#333;! Por Victori&#333;! Por Victori&#333;!"<br><br>The roar of the crowd shook the plaza, a deafening chant of patriotism. The mob was amassed around a humble stage, set up in the plaza for public events and demonstrations. The crowed undulated, as each patriot shoved his fist into the sky as an act of pride, chanting, yelling. Almost simultaneously, everyone in the mob fell silent, their eyes now focused on the meek looking man who presently cleared his voice.<br><br>"People of Pensalum!"<br><br>The man's voice echoed through the crowd, carried by large speakers. A momentarily cheer came from the mob, which was stopped by the man with a subtle raise of his hand.<br><br>"I am a messenger, a humble courier, carrying the tale of a greater plight. For too long, has corruption seeped into our great nation. This corruption comes in the form of taxes, atheism, homosexuality, but most of all, this corruption is a God-forsaken system called Socialism!"<br><br>Applause erupted from the crowd once more. Some vocal members repeated their earlier chant.<br><br>"Now friends, I know the struggles we each face, I know the hardships we must overcome. We are accused of being Fascists, sometimes even Nazis. However, we cannot let these blind accusations get in the way of the truth. We are nothing more than God fearing patriots! Now, we emerge, after our government has decided to support this communist Empress in Ghant. We have expressed our support for Laoni Yousloff, but our government ignores us. I don't know about you, friends, but I for one don't want to live in a country where my opinions are ignored."<br><br>He continues after another bout of cheering.<br><br>"Friends! Let us not forget the recent events that have shook our glorious nation. The attacks of terror, the storms and droughts, our terrible economic troubles! These catastrophes are not a simple coincidence, or the result of global warming, as some lie spewing liberal commies will have you know. No, these events are direct sins of our lord and savior Jesus, telling us to repent our ways. If we do not listen, these liberals will drag our Pensalum into the scornful fires of hell."<br><br>He pauses, to let his words sink in.<br><br>"Do not be alarmed though, friends. There is still yet time to climb out of this pit of sin. There is still time to remove our "leader" &#308;&#333;hann&#333; &#256;tat, the Antichrist, from office. It will not be easy, friends, but I know that together, anything is achievable. And mark my words, I will lead us to a new age, an age of freedom, an age of God. For now however, go home, hug your children, and prepare for the coming dawn. For on that day, we will storm the Chancieler's palace, and forcefully remove him from office!"<br><br>Again, shouts of encouragement exploded from the mob.<br><br>"We are the people, and we will fight for our rights! These fat cats cannot hold us back, we will rise and we will install a new regime. A regime under the name of the Pensic Front!"<br><br>At this, the masses began a new chant, echoing the name of their idol, as if he were a deity.<br><br>"Lyle Ferr! Lyle Ferr! Lyle Ferr!"<br><br>Lyle Ferr steps away, trembling from his speech. He smiles after the hearing his name repeated, and takes one last look at the mob.<br><br>He thrusts his fist into the air, and the crowd repeats the salute.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Vasjkai, Saurvai Klesvemovai</span><br><br>Irestocles had taken the most un-prestigious airline to get to the most disgusting, rat-filled, crowded, and smoggy city in Teaurnai. Vasjkai. Vasjkai was a modern city, built only twenty years ago, but had grown to the largest city in Teaurnai, followed by the capital, Saurnai. Vasjkai, in Teaurnai'i, meant "Olive City". Vasjkai was famous for the olive exports to most nations in the world. <br><br>However, Vasjkai was not all it seemed to be. It was a hellhole of crime, drugs, and un-orderliness. The Yresxjekleos (Hegemonial Guard) had given up trying to quell the city and now it was practically its own city state, kept within the borders of Teaurnai. <br><br>Why had Irestocles come here? Well, Vasjkai was ruled by a syndicate of cooperative crime organizations, all which could be used to his advantage. His first target: Kle Resmajorneo Xereoilkj (Green Poison).</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">The News Conference Room, The Spring Palace, Alexandria</span></span><br><br>Finally it was decided.<br><br>Everything had been considered and minutely planned: a sudden blitz of enemy radar installations followed by a rapid amphibious assault, an invasion by paratroopers pretending to be a meteor shower, a fake diplomatic conference, an intelligence insertion of kidnappers posing as tourists/film-makers/businessmen - but all of these had the following problem: Arresting 'General' Krugger was rather impossible as it would either require subterfuge, in which case it might not work, or war, in which case it would be expensive, not to mention quite counterproductive<br><br>Therefore in despair the Extra-Judicial Agency agreed to stop directly trying to kidnap General Krugger and haul him before an Ausitorian Judge; and instead to apply sanctions.<br><br>Sanctions, in the usual parlance of modern diplomacy, implies that a nation will not be allowed to trade certain goods with or via another. However, this was to be more than a seizure of certain assets. This was to be a full-scale naval blockade (with exceptions for craft carrying basic foodstuffs and medicines, and goods for those not working for General Krugger). Still, better than war, eh? <br><br>Lord Palmerston rose to address the hall of reporters, in a speech already being sent to governments around the region and beyond.<br><br>"Considering the devious and brutal coup de'tat launched by the illegitimate General Krugger in Rhodesea, which saw such terrible scenes as the summary execution of President Anton Zhakav without an international trial, it is with great regret that The Imperial Commonwealth Realms hereby declares that effective 60 minutes from now, we will establish a <span style="font-style: italic">complete exclusion zone covering all craft within the EEZ of Rhodesea</span>, i.e. all seas within 200 nautical miles and not claimed by another Government. Craft already in the zone should return to the place where they entered this zone forthwith.<br><br>All goods and craft found in these areas will be seized or sunk on sight unless they are carrying basic foodstuffs or medicines, or unless the goods are designed to enwealthen only those not working for General Krugger, or the goods are taking a short cut to and from a place outside Rhodesea. Fishing craft and craft supplying persons working on seaborne installations such as oil rigs will also be exempt. Craft designated to handle Environmental Catastrophes such as Oil spills will also be exempt. <br><br>Craft will be seized or sunk on sight unless they have <span style="font-style: italic">previously</span> obtained a permit from this government for such exceptions prior to entering the zone. <br><br>Ausitorian law and emergency services shall be extended to all craft within the EEZ, so that persons committing acts contrary to Ausitorian Law, such as murder or torture, shall continue to face our arrest; persons in need of urgent medical assistance shall be treated on floating hospitals; and persons in need of fire-fighting services shall be amply supplied with firemen.<br><br>I hope that nations of the world will understand that we have chosen this course of action instead of deciding to make war in the hope to avoid a bloody conflict. It remains, however, our hope that General Krugger and his supporters will be seriously inconvenienced by these measures.<br><br>This blockade will continue until power is returned to a legitimate government, or until General Krugger is handed in to our Court or an International Court of repute on the charges of Manslaughter, Contempt of Justice, and Treason. We have 3 carrier strike groups and submarine forces to enforce this exclusion zone. That is all."</div>
