Yet, ignoring the context, it was a beautiful journey around the slopes of the mountains of Ormont, and crossing the Great Bridge of Ormont across the Ormont river. By the time Smith became sick of the ambassador's screaming (which happened rather promptly), he exclaimed, "Shut up and I'll let you live!". Indeed, that got the Ambassador to discontinue his screams.<br><br>After driving through hours of desert, remote roads, and of course through the Great Bridge of Ormont, the car arrived not at Magecastle, but at the remote city of Wingcaster. But there was no time to stop to go to the Wingcaster Pub, or any other part of the beautiful city. Instead, they were going to Motokata. The liberal, left-wing nation was known for its open welcoming of ex-slaves, refugees, and those escaping persecution, just as Saverchenko-Colleti was. But of course, they were to meet traitors to the good of the Ice people at the border.<br><br>"Attention -- individuals incoming in my scope. This is Corporal James." called the guard present where they were to cross, through his radio to the other guards.<br><br>Before the Unit could prepare a reaction, Smith took out a hand rifle, and immediately shot James dead. Smith gestured Saverchenko-Colleti to cross to Motokata, before the other guards appeared. As the other guards targetted Smith, he managed to dodge most fire -- yet, he was already bleeding from his left arm and only barely managed to maim the Unit Colonel as to make him unable to stand. The pandemonium was great, and Smith continued to be targetted with gunfire and target others with gunfire.<br><br>That was, until the Unit Commander loaded the Unit cannon. The well-concealed, underground-based cannon finally shot Smith dead. Of course, the confrontation left the Unit with four personnel less.<br><br>Meanwhile, Saverchenko-Colleti was met by the highly militarised border patrol on the Motokatan end. Ignored by the Unit who was still focused on Smith, Saverchenko-Colleti introduced himself to the Motokatan guard _<br><br>"Greetings, I am Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti. I am a former World Assembly ambassador for The Ice States, but am escaping persecution by the nation's government for my submission of a proposal to the World Assembly intended to protect the rights of religious individuals. I was clandestinely delivered by the individual appointed as my executor to Motokata to escape; he is the individual fighting with Ice border guards right now." Saverchenko-Colleti then handed the border guard a paper copy of the <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/page=UN_view_proposal/id=magecastle_embassy_building_a5_1669447266" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">proposal in question</a>.<br><br>As Saverchenko-Colleti was let in, he was to start a new life in a new nation. Yet, his new life would change the history of the Ice States forever...</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata/Ice States border crossing<br>Near Wingcaster, Ice States</span><br><br>The Motokatan-Ice States border was one of the many highly militarized borders of the world. While both nations actively tried to avoid open hostilities, occasionally border guards exchanged fire, often due to misunderstandings, or illegal crossings. Many of those illegal crossings would be refugees seeking asylum, and other times it would be slave hunting parties who stumbled to close to the border. Due to this, border security was one of the more dangerous assignments, requiring skilled and knowledgeable leadership. <br><br>The border checkpoint near Wingcaster was no different, being near a small city it meant that there was a lot of civilian foot traffic. Lots of accidental crossings, smuggling, and the occasional gunfire from the Ice States side as someone didn't make it to the border in time. <br><br>Today was one of the days they heard gunfire from the Ice State's and moved quickly into defensive mode. There were maybe only a Platoon's worth of soldiers stationed here, but all of them poured out of their barracks, some barely dressed, but still wearing body armor and rifles. Machine gun positions were manned, and radios were reaching out to unit command reporting gunfire along the border. <br><br>The lone diplomat running along the road didn't appear as a threat, but the military forces shooting at him did. Still, they couldn't do anything until he crossed the painted line on the road, officially crossing into Motokata. <br><br>Barely were both feet into Motokata when the soldiers reacted. Smoke grenades went off around him, concealing him from Ice States border guards, while a pair of soldiers with ballistic shields and PDWs rushed him and threw him behind themselves. While they formed a shield, others rushed in and pulled him to the safety of a concrete barrier. When the smoke cleared, all the Ice States would see was two men in the middle of the road, ballistic shields up and machine gun positions covering them. <br><br>It was official, Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti had made it to Motokata and was now under their protection. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata City, Capital of Motokata <br>Member nation of the People's Unified Federation<br>Three days later</span><br><br>Once it became clear who Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti was, he was immediately flown to the capital, where the PUF Foreign Ministry took ownership of him. He was assigned a security guard, a buff Mokan soldier who barely fit in his dress suit by the name of Sergeant Minor Javier, and a private suite in the Foreign Ministry building for special guests such as himself. <br><br>It wouldn't be long until Deputy Foreign Minister Ramil Mayuga of Motokata would invite him down to his office for a one on one meeting: <br><br>"Alexander, per the laws of the Oligarchy of Motokata, anyone fleeing the Ice States is welcome to claim sanctuary in our borders, but you've pissed off a lot of people by escaping, do you have a plan of what to do now?"</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stonegrad, The Ice States</span><br><br>Emperor Sotolo was just about to go to sleep, as he received an email from General Burkes _<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">Dear Emperor,<br><br>According to present Air border security units, the individual "Marcus Smith" appears to have engaged in a border confrontation with Ice guards in the Motokatan frontier, near Wingcaster. He was escaping in a car of the Duchy of Deephedge, and was carrying another individual in his car who escaped into Motokata.<br><br>The individual has not been definitively identified, but given the circumstances of his death sentence, as well as the individual's appearance, I believe that the individual is in fact the disgraced Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti. The aerial footage -- which I have attached to this email -- further elucidates that he was allowed into Motokata by their border guards.<br><br>I am informing you of this to allow the Ice government to determine an appropriate response to this incident.<br><br>Thank you,<br><span style="font-style: italic">~Lionel Burkes,<br>General of the Ice Military</span></blockquote><br><br>He clicked into the attached footage. Nothing specular, it was ostensibly -- a white car driving into-. Wait. It was indeed branded as being from the Duchy of Deephedge. And the individuals who came out of the car were definitely Marcus Smith and...Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti! And, Motokata had let the latter in.<br><br>Sotolo tersely replied to the email, with a copy to Jeramy Vliet, the Duke of Magecastle.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">I expected nothing better from those bastards at the PUF. Motokata shall extradite the traitor, or face sanctions. If necessary, we shall take the traitor by force.</blockquote><br><br>Accordingly, a secured transmission, which was also tersely worded, was sent to the embassy of the PUF in Magecastle _<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">From: Emperor Sotolo II<br>To: Embassy of the People's United Federation<br><br>Salutations.<br><br>A convicted traitor to the Ice States, Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti, has been allowed into Motokata. He shall be immediately extradited to the Ice States, or we will enforce sanctions upon the PUF, including terminating its embassy with the Ice States.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Emperor Sotolo II,<br>The Empire of The Ice States</span></blockquote><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata City, Motokata</span><br><br>The ex-ambassador replies: "Well, you see, I was privy to a lot as World Assembly Ambassador. The repeal of 430 was indeed a scheme, but the goal was -- along with repealing various other resolutions, including the ban on genocide -- to allow the Ice States to eventually join the World Assembly. I think doing so was sabotaged by the submission of Religious Freedom Protection, as the Ice response would certainly have exposed that ulterior motive. However, I still intend to expose the underhanded, corrupt, and illicit activity perpetrated by the Ice States that I was personally privy to as World Assembly Ambassador. I would also note that, given circumstances such as the Harold Smith protests last year, there will almost certainly be some form of rebellion against the Empire soon to establish a much more benevolent regime, which would be fueled by such revelations."</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata City, Motokata</span> <br><br>Deputy Foreign Minister Ramil Mayuga listened to the ex-ambassador's reasoning. It was a good story, or at least it could be. <br><br>"As you may or may not be aware, the People's Unified Federation is not a member of the World Assembly, nor was Motokata prior to its unification with the Federation. The activities of that bureaucratic organization are often not a priority for us.<br><br>That said, you are perhaps the highest ranking member of the Ice States government to cross the border and request sanctuary. Many refugees who cross our border are often given new starts in the Federal Colonies of Stanlitio in Craxx, or Isla Alma, but given your situation, it may be better to resettle you within a proper Federal nation. <br><br>I have no doubt that the Ice States will demand your return, and promise threats to see it happen. What you share with me will be shared with the leadership of the Federation, and we will have to decide what to do from there. Based on what you've said, and what you plan to share, I can imagine the Ice States will be difficult. Luckily for you, the Federation is quite adept at propaganda, as is their state influenced media, the Mokastana News Network. I am sure they will be interested in hearing your words soon. For now, you will remain a guest of the Federal Ministry of Foriegn Affairs and the Government of Motokata."</div>

He shall be immediately extradited to the Ice States, or we will enforce sanctions upon the PUF, including terminating its embassy with the Ice States.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Emperor Sotolo II,<br>The Empire of The Ice States</span></blockquote><br><br></div></blockquote><br><br><hr><br><br>The message was forwarded from the Federal Embassy in Magecastle to Motokata City, as well as to the Federation Capital, Mokastana City. As it was a threat against the entire Federation, it became a matter of Federal importance. A meeting between the President of the Federation and the Security Council was quickly organized, and via secure link the leadership of Motokata was brought in as well. Starting the meeting was President of the Federation Ben Rodriguez:<br><br>"So, a well known slave state has threatened us with sanctions, if we don't return a traitor who crossed into Federal Territory. I know the Oligarchy often handles their own foreign relations in the far west, but can I get an overview of what is going on?"<br><br>State Holder Hoshi Oda turned to Deputy Foreign Minister Ramil Mayuga who could brief the Federal Security Council more effectively. <br><br>"President of the Federation Rodriguez, earlier this week, the ambassador from the Ice States to the World Assembly proposed legislation to the WA that was against his orders. He believes this resolution will destroy his nation's attempts of joining the WA, but he also believes that the Ice States will be undergoing social and political upheaval soon. He wishes to reveal to the world the corruption of the Ice States." <br><br>"And I take it the Ice States would not like that to be leaked. Do we have any reason from Motokatan intelligence or the Bureau of Secret Actions indicating rebellion in the Ice States?"<br><br>The director of the Bureau of Secret Affairs spoke up: "Nothing concrete, but there is certainly unexpected activity going on. We are not sure what it is, but a rebellion from within government factions is a possibility."<br><br>"We must also recognize that Alexander was scheduled for execution, but instead was delivered to the border, either they have no security for traitors, or he had help escaping the country." Generalissimo Major Hiraku Hayato replied.<br><br>As talk continued, the Air Marshal Jesus Manual spoke up: "If we want to go by the letter of the law, the Motokatan Policy of Sanctuary specifies sanctuary based on religious, sexual, racial, or enslaved persecution. Unfortunately betraying the government doesn't quite fall under one of those requirements. Might I propose we give him a chance to share his concerns with the world, then ship him back?"<br><br>"That's a cold way of putting it, Jesus." President Rodriguez responded, "but we need to decide what to do with him. We barely trade with these slavers anyways, what could their sanctions even do to us?"<br><br>Primary Admiral Jesus Consuelo replied: "They might try to cut off Motokatan trade, but they can't touch the Motokatan Northern Sea, and to the south the Sea of Faith is predominantly controlled by the Marshites. If they attack our ships the combined Federal and Marshite navies would make short work of their attempts to deny us the sea."<br><br>"Militarily, we would win, yes, but is the economic impact and possible war worth this man's life?" This time the Economic Adviser questioned.<br><br>"That is the question&#8230;. Normally this would be a Motokatan question, but with the Federation threatened, we all need to cooperate on this. What do you think State Holder Oda?"<br><br>"Deputy Foreign Minister Mayuga proposed an idea that I approve of. Give the traitor an interview with MNN, and let him talk. If his words prove value, we can leverage that value in our negotiations with the Ice States. If one high ranking Ice State's government official escaped to our borders, there may be more. What we do with this one will send a message to the Ice States and beyond, not only with what we can be trusted with, but with how much power the Ice States can wield."<br><br>"Very well, Elizabeth, find a way to delay with the Ice States, get that interview going&#8230;."<br><br><br><hr><br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><div style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px"><span style="font-weight: bold">From: Embassy of the People's Unified Federation <br>Magecastle, The Ice States<br>To: Ice States Diplomatic Operations</span> <br><br><br>We have received your request for the extradition of <span style="font-weight: bold">ALEXANDER NICHOLAS SAVERCHENCKO-COLLETI</span>.

The truth for Icers had come, and they could see the real activites by the corrupt, theocratic, and totalitarian government which had oppressed them for so long.</div>

He hesitates, before his sentence is completed by McShane.<br><br>"Leaked. We know. The traitor Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti leaked files of Operation Diamond Dog. The world knows, and the information has permeated the Ice States."<br><br>Gant replied, "How can we continue Operation Diamond Dog if the world knows?

<div class="content"><div style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px"><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">FEDALA, IMPERIAL PROVINCE, THE GOLDEN THRONE</span></span><br><br>"For the sake of the gods, these fools have blundered themselves into another morass." Lara Surr, like the other kr&#237;erlords, was looking at the packet of information they had all been given days prior to the kuncil's convening.<br><br>They were all reading the leaked document on Diamond Dog, the program to remove and eliminate Icean residents of Czaslyudian descent. Although the Golden Throne was not a stranger to these sorts of programs, having committed a similar action against Ordenites in Nicaro during the last war, the fact was that the Iceans had been sloppy and that showed in the faces of the kr&#237;erlords in the room. And the room reeked of frustration. The Golden Throne had stuck its neck out for the Ice States, going as far as signing a mutual defense agreement. The Diamond Dog leak made the Golden Throne look bad.<br><br>Surr added, "We should end our arms shipments immediately."<br><br>There were some murmurs but it was His Imperial Majesty's voice that was heard above the rest. "We will sign no new contracts with the Ice States for the time being. But we will honor the existing contracts."<br><br>White-haired Kr&#237;erlord Daryl Novelle, long considered the emperor's right-hand man, spoke next. "This leak will send shockwaves throughout the region. I, and I am sure all of us here, have no doubt that the Marshites will rescind their Mer'cia Extrema. And we can only imagine what additional steps they will take but I would not rule out military intervention. We should make our position clear to protect our friendships with states that are likely to look at this situation adversely. We should release a statement immediately, Your Imperial Majesty."<br><br>Fedor's expression betrayed no emotion. He pondered for a moment, then said, "Remember that we have interests in the Ice States. First, this new situation should not change the details of our emancipation agreement. Second, we extended a significant loan to their imperial government. Whatever happens, we should make clear that we expect that loan to be repaid against the agreed-upon terms. There are no exceptions. Third, the new situation will not affect the economic agreements between our two states. Fourth, and finally, we expect that TOCAIF will continue to be respected, regardless of how the situation evolves. I expect that any statement you make, Kr&#237;erlord Novelle, will communicate our stake and our position of leadership, especially as it regards progress toward emancipation. Our distancing from the Icean government must not come at the cost of these interests."<br><br>"Of course, Your Imperial Majesty," replied Novelle.<br><br>After a moment of silence, Surr said, "If the regime was able to murder Czaslyudians, it will murder protestors as well. And even if they don't, the Diamond Dog leak may be enough to trigger military action by other states. My point is that the situation is likely to continue spiraling negatively. With all due respect, Your Imperial Majesty, a statement alone may be insufficient to protect all of our interests. I have in mind TOCAIF, and also the great economic investment we have made in southern Nicaro to facilitate expanded trade flows into TIS."<br><br>"A statement is all we will make for now," said Fedor. "When the situation evolves, so will our response."<br><br>What the emperor didn't mention was that he had thought through that scenario. A certain circle within Fuermak High Command was already working on a limited intervention operation in case the situation called for it, with the explicit objective of protecting imperial economic interests in TIS. If things came to this extreme, Surr &#8212; as the kr&#237;erlord posted to Nicaro &#8212; would be brought into the loop. But there was no need to inform her now, not of a hypothetical that didn't require her expertise anyway.<br><br>Discussion continued among the kr&#237;erlords for some time thereafter. That same day, Novelle issued an official statement from the Imperial Bureaucracy:<br><br><br>"His Imperial Majesty expresses a deep disappointment in the imperial government of the Ice States. Its genocide of Czaslyudian peoples residing within Icean borders is inexcusable, going against all moral precepts of the free world. He, and the Golden Throne in general, are deeply frustrated with a government that was otherwise showing progress towards civilization through the emancipation program it had agreed upon with our government. It goes without saying that we unequivocally condemn the Ice States.<br><br>As a result of the details surrounding Operation Diamond Dog, the Golden Throne will cease all future arms contracts with the Icean state and military. We also will reiterate the Ice States' obligations towards the Golden Throne, including the repayment of a 30-year loan made to fund the emancipation process and the defense of the Ice States from the Czaslyudian blockade. We also reiterate the Ice States' obligation in terms of fulfilling the terms of the emancipation agreement. We expect the Ice States to continue on its path towards being a free state. The Golden Throne will continue to oversee this process and will serve consequences if the Ice States fail to meet any of the above obligations, and any other obligations agreed upon by treaty, including and not short of military intervention. We honor our agreements and we expect other countries to honor theirs.<br><br>&#8212; Kr&#237;erlord Daryl Novelle on behalf of His Imperial Majesty Fedor I"<br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">ICEAN FRONTIER, SATRAPY OF NICARO</span></span><br><br>The imperial military had withdrawn from the Ice States after the Czaslyudian threat had subsided, not too long ago. Much of this military power remained in southern Nicaro, not yet able to fully redeploy to the permanent bases that individual units had come from. This process of redeployment quietly ceased, regardless. Instead, these Fuermak forces again began to shift southward again. They moved along what was known as the Icean Frontier, the international border between the Satrapy of Nicaro and the Empire of the Ice States. If they moved across that border, this time it surely would not be in defense of that country.<br><br>When Lara Surr returned to Matagalpa, in the Prefecture of Firmador, she was unsuspecting of this subtle change in the Fuermak's posture. But, in the back of her mind, there was something telling her that if the Golden Throne had to intervene in the Ice States again, this time the approach would be more...forceful vis-a-vis the Icean government.</div></div>

Absolute chaos. Under speeding lights were thousands of protesters, all campaigning in response to the revelation of Operation Diamond Dog, as well as the closure of relations with the PUF. It was almost as if one could see from space the Mokan flags, and banners of "Czaslyudian Lives Matter", and "You are to refrain from any violent vices towards any believers" -- a verbatim quote from the Holy Book of Klyprer. Flags hung on tall poles too were combusted in a spectacular display of fire.<br><br>This protest was far from limited to Stonegrad -- most of Cruxhampton was covered, Valenpool and Southport City were both home to more protest marches, and protestors were in fact sitting outside of the Magecastle Embassy Complex in rememberance of Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti. Even Deephedge housed protests, as did various minor towns throughout the Ice States. These protests were not only illegal, but they were illegal enough to bring full military force upon the protesters.<br><br>The protest had begun nearly three hours ago, since the closure of the embassy with the PUF was announced. A response to the matter was therefore not simple on the part of the Ice States, which had begun sending Land Force divisions to break up the smaller protests. These unfortunate protesters only received one verbal warning before being shot and massacred.<br><br>Yet, the protests in Stonegrad were too large for this to be possible. Action against the protesters en masse was needed -- especially when Stonegrad was indeed where the protests originated, and nobody could even exit any building they were in due to being blocked by the protesters.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">From: Emperor Sotolo II<br>To: General Lionel Burkes<br><br>You have my permission.<br><br>Signed,<br><span style="font-style: italic">~Sotolo II,<br>Emperor,<br>The Empire of The Ice States</span></blockquote><br><br>This was the email which determined the fate of Stonegrad, and thus the Ice States. Just minutes later, Ice military drone-helicopters begun flying around Stonegrad. Then, they nigh-simoultaneously dropped white weapons onto the city. When they landed, they exploded turning the sky green. The chemical bombing of Stonegrad had begun.<br><br>The protesters in Stonegrad, as well as numerous other civilians, albeit less than the protesters, who merely happened to be outdoors in the area, albeit less than the protesters, began to involuntarily defecate and puke on the streets. The scum on the streets rendered many unable to stand up without slipping into the feces of others; yet, it was only in a few more seconds that the chemical agents released upon the city would cause a painful cardiac arrest of the victims of the unconscious substance. The screams of innocents drowned the city, but no more than Stonegrad's civilians suffered collective punishment at the hands of the Ice States.<br><br><hr><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Stonegrad, The Ice States. 3:33 PM.</span><br><br>This incident notwithstanding, no city was otherwise deterred. The General, Lionel Burkes, held a virtual meeting to discuss the matter with his Colonels and the Emperor.<br><br>"We can't just bomb Cruxhampton again!", exclaimed General Burkes.<br><br>"Yes, we can!" replied Sotolo II.<br><br>"How many more cities do we need to lose? Look, the bombing of Stonegrad was necessary. But if we lose cities to these protesters, we're just cutting our nose to spite our face!"<br><br>Before the Emperor could reply, Colonel Tibett spoke.<br><br>"I have an idea."<br><br>"We should threaten the Cruxhamptonian protesters that we will remove them by force just as we did in Stonegrad if they do not promptly remove themselves. If they refuse, we will bomb Cruxhampton."<br><br>"The idea has my approval" replied both the Emperor and General at exactly the same time.<br><br>"Tibett, send three remote helicopters loaded with fire bombs to Cruxhampton. I will issue a statement to the city shortly, demanding that the protesters remove themselves within one hour, or Cruxhampton will be destroyed." Replied the Emperor.<br><br><hr><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Cruxhampton, The Ice States. 3:50 PM.</span><br><br>The following statement was promptly issued by Emperor Sotolo II, signed by the General Lionel Burkes.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Statement on Protests in Cruxhampton</span></span></div><br><br>At 3:25 PM, chemical weapons were administered onto the city of Stonegrad. These were applied to remove protesters from the city, who had been attacking the divine-sanctioned regime, including by combusting the national flag and other national insignia. We would like to thank Colonel Paul Tibett for his incredible selflessness in managing the remote aircraft which delivered these weapons.<br><br>However, protests remain active in the city of Cruxhampton. These attacks on the sovereignty of the Ice States are unacceptable. We have indeed placed drones over the city able to administer weapons of mass destruction upon Cruxhampton. However, we give one hour, since the publication of this statement, to allow protesters present in Cruxhampton to peacefully remove themselves from Cruxhampton.<br><br>Should they fail to comply, we will administer the warheads we have already prepared upon Cruxhampton.<br><br>Signed,<br><span style="font-style: italic">~Sotolo II,<br>Emperor,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Lionel Burkes,<br>General of the Ice Military,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Klyprer,<br>Lord of the Cosmos,<br>With behalf of the Chief Scribe,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.</span></blockquote></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Magecastle, The Ice States<br>Embassy complex B<br>B1: Embassy of Holy Marsh<br>8:15:45 AM</span><br><br>Ambassadress <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eqe5FZY.png" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Ashala Illahee</a> had a long day ahead of her. The situation between the People's United Federation and the member-state of Motokata and the Empire of Ice States was a headache for her. She had been selected precisely because she was the most lenient of the candidates when it came to the Ice States. It had proved taxing. They were as arrogant in their claims of divinity as any heathen nation she had encountered and while she often used the argument that it made them little different from her homeland in that regard, it was a wearying argument. Still, she had accomplished what she considered a great deal in a short time and was proud of her work.<br><br>Her skills were certainly being put to the test. There was absolutely no debate about who the Theocratic Matriarchy would support in any confrontation, as the PUF was a notable and strong ally and many would rather have seen the Empire burn than deal with them as neighborly states. Still, she had tried to open up lines of communication further down. No one wanted to have a citizen of theirs become a traitor, especially a high government official. The incident at the border had ended with death, and it was easy to understand the necessity of solving the crisis on some terms of appreciable effectiveness on the side of the Empire.<br><br>Not that she expected that to happen. All she could really hope for was that whatever sanctions were levied would prove satisfying to the need for retribution for the Empire. She had intimated that it risked much more if it went further than that. Whether they cared about her opinions or not, she felt it important to keep them well aware of the Theocracy's strong kinship with the PUF. Sanctions? She could smooth that over with her superiors.<br><br>She had set up for her day, with important meetings scheduled and a number of personal engagements in order to try and help both sides see reason. The Embassy itself was only now starting to buzz- it was always busy, of course, but around eight was when it became fully staffed. People were still settling in, concerns were being addressed, small deals being discussed and the real start of lasting relationships happening across the building.<br><br>She took a drink of water before her office turned red.<br><br>*****<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">AI-Citizen Cluster Zaphia-18 was in charge of Informational Security for the Marshite embassy. When the leaks happened, it took less than two seconds for it to analyze them, come to its conclusions, consult with two AI-Superiors, and then for them to alert Foreign Church Service Coordinator Alyson Saiza with their conclusions. It took Saiza eight seconds to open up their alert. Saiza read the conclusion and input a command in twenty-two seconds, activating a pre-set series of orders. Zaphia-3 confirmed the orders and discussed the situation with her superiors and made slight alterations in three more seconds. It took one second for her to activate the orders, and three seconds for AI Citizen Cluster Octar-1- who was in charge of Building Security- to reconfirm with all Clusters involved and its own superiors and then activate its own plans.</span><br><br>*****<br><br>The Ambassadress took a drink of water as the office turned red, as the chips in her head transmitted the voices of her AI comrades.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">"Ambassadress, by order of the Arch-Bishop and in accordance with contingencies, this embassy is being closed due to a new development. Your staff has been alerted. Transportation has been arranged. Information shall be delivered to your secured devices with arrangements and causes,"</span> Zaphia-3 said, her voice as even as it always was. It was sometimes hard to remember that the Citizen Clusters were thinking creatures with their own personalities when you dealt with some of them. They were very, very good at their jobs that way.<br><br>The Ambassadress put her water glass down and started walking to her desk. When you worked in a land like this, you made sure to keep an evacuation bag ready. She grabbed it and it alone.<span style="color: #FF0040"> "I assume docu-"</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">"All documentation has been secured for future use. Local copies are being eradicated, and all equipment rendered unrecoverable,"</span> she responded.<br>Small machine-like whirs could be heard from the desks and file cabinets as well. There was not a tremendous amount of physical documentation that was considered important to be kept, and those that were deemed so had special storage requirements. They had been coated with laminate-like material that when it reached a certain temperature would near-instantly burn, and the cabinets they were kept in were temperature controlled. Octar-1 used his controls to break what limits were available and within a few moments they would start to burn, leaving naught but ash, yet contained and controlled out of human sight.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">"All sensitive physical materials are already being eradicated. All copies located outside of storage are being located. Staff near them are being notified to dispose of them using standard procedures."</span><br><br><span style="color: #FF0040">"I see. Good job, you two,"</span> The Ambassadress said. Outside of her office many staff members were now responding as they started preparing to evacuate.<br><br>The security staff did their part as well. They started putting the additional weapons and equipment that were to be transported into their appropriate transports, while others stayed vigilant for any activity outside of the embassy. Still, it was unexpected for there to be anything too interesting to develop over the moments that followed. It had been some time since relations had warmed and there had been nary a negative development. Once weapons and other equipment that could not be destroyed were secured appropriately they would start destroying servers and the storage cabinets. It was considered overkill, but overkill was the only kill that was acceptable regardless when it came security.<br><br>When it was time, staff started to exit the embassy in their vehicles to the pre-arranged transports that would take them out of country. Lower level staff first, followed by others. The Ambassadress and her personal staff would be last and when the building was emptied, vehicles left, and security measures fully followed, security would finish. Once they were gone the two AIs would do a few more checks to erase and remove themselves. Their final action would be kill-codes sent to their software and hardware as their awareness transferred out of the embassy. The lights flickered a few times and turned off, leaving the embassy cold and silent.<br><br>*******************<br>Mar'si, Holy Marsh<br>8:15 AM<br><br>Arch-Bishop Luboski had already called a meeting of top officials. It followed her early morning sermons and would be the precursor to her trip to a Romandean Shrine to promote voting in the ongoing Bishop Elections. The meeting involved multiple M-SAD officials as well as one of her top Fenne, Biycan Dae. The agenda item had been the ongoing elections as well as a short discussion of the developing situation with the Ice States and the Federation. An alert flashed across the room by 8:15:51, detailing an emergency development regarding the Ice States, seeking to pull the agenda up. Luboski looked at the alert for a few moments before nodding. By 8:16:25 a report collated by the AI Citizen Clusters MSTANNIS-IX IX arrived, flashing on the holographic interface that occupied the center table. The various officials and Luboski brusquely tapped their consoles and brought up the leaks themselves as well as the evolving AI Analysis through the use of other intelligence. A third report would pop up. this time by M-SAD human analysts. It would be slower of course, but no less important.<br><br>The next few minutes were spent reading, small commentary shared between the gathered.<br>It was Supreme Analyst Sicar-So Sein-Sar who broke it up. "Our fears have been confirmed."<br>"Our beliefs have been, you mean," replied Supreme Analyst Daytson Chajara. He looked up at Luboski. "Your Holiness, your trust has once more been betrayed, it seems."<br>"You cannot betray trust that has not been given, Analyst Chajara," Luboski responded, her soft-spoken voice no less filled with authority. "I gave them the Mer'cia Extrema for it was the right way to give them a chance. No one trusted them more than to be given a chance," she continued, standing up. As she did so, the walls of the room shifted to show some of the early election results. A long way to go, but the faithful were certainly making their voices heard.<br>"How many of the Faith have voted in the Ice States?" She asked, while Senior Analyst Jasvika Hoondui's eyes flickered briefly for a few moments. The cyborg connected briefly.<br>"Early returns are unknown, Your Holiness. Strict reporting standards by the Empire mean we are unlikely to know for a few hours longer. Our initial projects are of median turnout, though we experience difficulties in comparison to other regions when trying to collect accurate data."<br>The Arch-Bishop nodded. "I see. Send word to them to remain vigilant and to not participate in any anti-government protesting," she said, fully expecting there to be violence.<br><br>Biycan Dae closed her copy of the report. "Disgusting, if not unexpected," she said to much agreement.<br>"Indeed. So what do we do now?" Chajara replied, noting how no one seemed to care about the World Assembly portion. The Theocratic Matriarchy was not a member nor a party to that foolish body.<br>Luboski paced around the room. She was angry that her decree had not been seen as the opportunity it was to change. A nation playing with its future should not in the extreme consume gasoline near open flames. "We will inform the Empire that these disgusting actions demand a cessation of all relations not related to the deal struck previously to end their slave trade. We are considering other responses and will inform them of our decision. We...will be watching," she said before she shook her head.<br>"The agreement struck years ago has helped free slaves and is working towards a better future for them. Now they threaten that which saved them...Analyst Sein-Sar, the Faithful in the Theocracy cannot access these leaks?"<br>"Correct. The website in question is not accessible, and we are vigilant on following the digital trail and killing it should it so much as approach our filters."<br><br>Good. She didn't need the Faithful to hear what is happening and become enraged. They would learn when she believed it right for them to know. It would also save them from having to make any public statement. No need for it now.<br>"I see, good," a pregnant pause. "I am rescinding the Mer'cia Extrema as of this moment, but since they are not classified as a slave state, we will not be taking immediate military action. However, activate our previous plans for dealing with the Ice States and prep them for immediate use. Give no greater indication and move no further forces into preparation," she said as she turned around to the assembled.<br>"Inform only the highest levels of allied governments and intelligence services of the rescinding of the Mer'cia Extrema. Outside of those who need to know, no one outside of this room will know either. When and if we do more than cut relations that are not necessary for the continuance of the anti-slavery deal we will work in concert with them on those actions," she said as she took her seat. "We are not at war, yet. And we hope for the sake of the anti-slavery pact we can avoid it. But when and if we do move, we will do so with absolutely no reservations. And it will not take much more than we are at to do this. Ensure this message is delivered and let them draw their own conclusions."<br>A pause<br>"Bring me the Inquisition. And bring me the Lord-Commander Militant of the Holy Warriors."<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">To: Empire of the Ice States<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">From the Desk of the Arch-Bishop</span><br><br>Effectively immediately all relations not related to your continued adherence to the emancipation agreement have been cut. Your violations in Operation: Diamond Dog are judged cruel and unlawful by the Holy Marsh. We will be considering future responses and will be watching how you conduct yourselves carefully.<br><br>Thought for the Day: With victories over others, we conquer. But with victories over ourselves, we are exalted.</blockquote><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-weight: bold">4:03 PM<br>Mar'si, Holy Marsh<br>The Arch-Bishop Prepares</span><br><br>The reports from the Empire confirmed the suspicions of the Arch-Bishop and her people. Not for nothing, they couldn't help but prove the worst theories about them correct, the worst opinions of them true. It wasn't enough for them to be slavers; it wasn't enough for them to commit acts of genocide; it wasn't enough for them to respond to protests with violence. They had to do everything. It appeared as though the Mer'cia Extrema was wasted. She would have to rescind it now. There was nothing else to do; her hand had been forced. <br><br>Operations were put into place. The 1st and 3rd Strategic were tasked with the southern and eastern coasts of the Empire respectively. The 7th Strategic Submarine Fleet would be in support, while the 2nd, 9th, and 10th Strategic Amphibious Fleets would get to work soon enough. In the air, six Air Crusades were activated and designated, while the one-hundred divisions of the 2nd Localized Army Crusade were being tasked. <br><br>Still, at the moment these were just plans. Even as protestors were getting slaughtered by the Empire, the Arch-Bishop did not yet give the word. It wasn't due to a lack of desire. Once she had seen the latest reports her heart had finally hardened entirely to the cause of kinship with the Empire in any manner, and she allowed herself to consider them damned. <br><br>Rather than launch a vast bombing campaign and invasion intended to snuff out the nation, she listened to another idea. One that was proposed by one of the few Marshites who seemed to give a shit about the overwhelming casualties that would be inflicted on the common people and slaves of the Empire.<br><br>------<br><span style="font-weight: bold">3:10 PM<br>Mar'si, Holy Marsh<br>The Ambassadress' Long-Shot<br></span><br>The Ambassadress took a drink of water, her first of several hours and her first drink back home in the Theocracy. It had been a nervy few hours with a terse exchange between the aircraft and Ice ATC on the way out. Landing in Ixana had seen her and her staff swiftly whisked aboard militart aircraft heading home. even then she could see the always-busy base starting to buzz at an even higher, jubilant degree. She knew why they were so happy and was determined to see to it that their joy was short-lived.<br><br>She was no fool. Her colleagues may have thought so, with her hope for the Ice States. But they misjudged her. She was no fool, no naive idealist. She well understood that the Empire was rotten, with its false religion and broken leadership wallowing in the muck of their own avarice. She knew they were doomed and knew it years ago. But she saw nobility in the people of the Ice States. A boldness and courage that was waiting for a moment to show itself. As she watched the protests start, she knew this was the moment.<br><br>If they were only allowed to do this themselves, then she would be vindicated and the people saved. She communicated with M-SAD and the Arch-Bishop and was granted a meeting. She walked into the meeting at 3:30 PM, as the first reports of the chemical attack were being sent out. They prayed while the reports grew more serious, and finished when it as well confirmed. When the meeting finally started, the Ambassadress knew she up to this task regardless of the new road blocks put in front of her...<br>------<br><span style="font-weight: bold">4:05 PM<br>Mar'si, Holy Marsh<br>The Arch-Bishop Has Listened</span><br><br>The Arch-Bishop read over the prepared statement as well as signed off on a series of actions. Utilizing information networks obtained by local Marshites and the work of the embassy with M-SAD, they would support the protestors in any and all means they asked for. If the people of the Ice States desired to fight for their freedom, they would find a line of credit, arms, support, and even direct intervention on the table. And if they did not, if the Ambassadress was wrong about the heat of the moment burning the cruelty of the past away, then it would be the Theocracy itself that would put the nation to the sword. A series of plans were laid out regardless and the Theocracy would move with agility between them.<br><br>The statement itself was the first Marshite acknowledgement of the events of the day, and was sent out through all channels. <br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">"The Empire of the Ice States has turned its back on good governance and good will and fully embraced cruelty and malice. As of this moment, we have severed all relations with the nation, and the Arch-Bishop has announced a rescinsion of the Mer'cia Extrema. It is expected that the Ice States shall remain in adherence to the previous agreement signed. As long as it does so, it is not a slave state.<br><br>This follows the revelations of an organized attempt at genociding Czaslyudian peoples in its nation and then attacking protestors of this action. This revelation is shocking, and the Arch-Bishop condemns the actions and all those involved. She has called for all those involved in the operation or the attack on protestors to be turned over to the proper Marshite authorities or the Greater D&#237;enstadi Freedom Organization.<br><br>We warn the Ice States that any action taken against Marshites in its lands will be taken as a direct act of war. We encourage the good citizens of the Ice States to let their voices be heard with the comfort and knowledge that they are supported by all members of the righteous world."</blockquote><br><br>After this statement was read aloud on news broadcasts and appeared at the top of every available webpage, the leaks and videos regarding the events of the Ice States would finally be available for Marshites to access. Meanwhile, one Air group was already in the skies flying towards a specific city- on a mission or protection and revenge.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">PUF-Motokata Embassy <br>Magecastle, Ice States</span><br><br>The Ambassador to the Ice States had been observing the deteriorating situation between the PUF and the Ice States for days now. Ever since he first got word that one of the border crossings had been a high ranking traitor, he knew the Ice States wouldn't back down regardless of the consequences, and he was right. Within a day the emperor had cut off all trade with the PUF and demanded the Embassy be evacuated within 12 hours. Needless to say, Sasha Protocol was initiated. <br><br>Sasha Protocol was the PUF's plans and procedures for evacuating an embassy from a hostile nation. One of the first steps in any diplomatic mission was finding ways to get their staff outside of the country in case things went south. Unfortunately, many of the lessons learned were from bitter experiences in Sasha, Greal, and attacks on other PUF embassies around the world. Experience was a harsh teacher, but an effective one, and the Federation had learned. <br><br>Plan A for the evacuation of the Federal Embassy involved flying in Mototakan made C-2 Cargo planes, supported by a Federal Il-76. These would fly into the local airport and land, where the Embassy was sending a convoy of Hussar Armored vehicles and civilian style armored cars full of staff. If all went well, the staff and Embassy Security escorts would be flown out of The Ice States within the first few hours of the notification. Plans B, C and D involved other ways to get to the Motokatan Border or the ocean for rescue, but hopefully those would not be required. <br><br>While the staff and civilians fled via cargo plane, a few squads of GDE(Grupo de Defensa de la Embajada) soldiers stayed behind to destroy everything. Kill commands were issued to computers, fire pits lit and documents shoved inside. Hard drives and encryption equipment were degaussed and had their thermite charges activated. As the fires burned inside the embassy, snipers and Anti-Tank units stationed in windows and rooftops of the embassy watched for any attackers who might decide 12 hours was too long. Once everything was properly destroyed, the final charges on building support columns would be set, and these squads would be on the final APCs to the airport. <br><br>Back at the Motokatan border, military units were put on high alert, especially the air force and air defense network. If anything happened to the evacuating embassy staff, it would be war. Cruise missile batteries were already setting targets inside the Ice States, army units along the border were armed and preparing to assault border stations and military emplacements. Fighter jets patrolled near the border, waiting for the transport planes to make it back, if anything fired at the transports or threatened them, they would be under orders to intervene. <br><br>From the order to close the embassy to the final plane taking off, it was only 4 hours. Unfortunately, it meant that many PUF civilians may still be in country, but hopefully they could get to either the border or the airport soon. <br><br>Back in the city, a squad of GDE soldiers remained behind, hiding in an apartment, wearing civilian clothes, with civilian luggage full of weapons. According to Sasha, Protocol, they were Plan D in case the host country became hostile and a rescue was required. Now with their embassy staff safely of country, they would remain on stand by in case the PUF needed a strike deep behind enemy lines. <br><br><hr><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata City, Motokata</span><br><br>Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti was a guest of Motokata, and by extension, The People&#8217;s Unified Federation, but his move to submit those documents to the internet had been a tough decision. The Federation decided to let him release them, as long as they could manufacture plausible deniability. Officially, he could not have uploaded them aa a guest of the Foreign Ministry, as they had firewalls explicitly blocking such data sharing websites, but there were internet cafes around, and numerous public wifis. Perhaps he did it while being escorted around town, perhaps using a public terminal or a rented laptop. Either way, it was done, and the PUF would remain silent on the topic, claiming they were looking into the leak. Better to look foolish, than claim you are actively releasing documents to destabilize another nation. <br><br>Either way, the PUF would increase his security, under the pretext of increased hostility, of course, but he was also now restricted to his VIP room in the Foriegn Ministry. In addition, as the Embassy was being evacuated, a reporter from MNN was allowed to enter his room with an armed escort. She claimed her name was &#8216;Sindi Domingo&#8217;, but it was irrelevant, she simply asked, &#8220;Do you have anything you would like to say to the world in response to the documents released yesterday?&#8221; However he answered, it wouldn&#8217;t change his fate, which was currently being decided by the PUF.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;">(Ooc: This post is co-written with <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Holy%20Marsh">Holy Marsh</a>.)</span><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxh1Y9sK7Tc" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Blood and Stone.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Cruxhampton, The Ice States. 4:46 PM.</span><br><br>The statement by the government of the Empire seemed to have minimal, if any, actual effect on the progress of the protests in Cruxhampton. The flags of the PUF and the World Assembly were highly visible, even with the black helicopters floating in the sky above them. No threat -- not even the burning of the entire city -- could deter the protesters from rebellion against the Empire.<br><br>Then a miracle happened, just as the fate of Cruxhampton within four minutes ostensibly remained clear.<br><br>In the sky, appeared more military-grade helicopters. However, they were not of the Ice military. Opponents of The Ice States based in Southport City had organised the sending of 32 manned aircraft to Cruxhampton, which were loaded with various improved explosive devices, utilising directionally focused charges. Indeed, they were sent by the Communist Freedom Army, a secret society in Southport City established to destroy the Empire. Now was the perfect time from the CFA to intervene.<br><br>But it was not only the CFA which deployed to the scene. Summoned by the CFA, the Marshite Groups 1 through 3 of the 8th Air Wing, 2nd Air Division, and 4th Air Crusade (1-3,8-2-4) appeared soon. Too soon. Far, far too soon. A total of thirty squadrons- 300 aircraft. The majority were MAF-50 Pegasus Light Multiroles, piloted by determined and experienced pilots. Numbers of the stealth variant, the MAF-50S Silent Pegasus, were spotted as well. A few LY910 Shadowhawks and LY908 Warhawks were spotted, as were a number of specialized.<br><br>There were very few bombers and AWACS support was handled at a distance. While the protestors on the ground could see the vastness of the support, they could not see what lay behind it and the truth would be buried for some time. However, those familiar with the Marshite military would recognize that this attack was small for them, and was not supported by the usual overwhelming support that accompanied their move. And if allied vessels or aircraft had been in the area, they would have noticed confusion among the Marshite forces.<br><br>Back in the Cruxhampton military base, the Marshite intruders were immediately spotted. So, the Ice fleets fired upon the Marshites on sight. One projectile, after another projectile, after another projectile. <br><br>The Marshites who had been summoned had two jobs. The first was to keep the skies over the city cleared, and the second was to hammer the base that the attacks were launched from as brutally as they could. They did not both with the usual Marshite methods of handling business, and instead went to their objectives with great aggression. A number of aircraft were shot down by both Ice States air defense and in air to combat, especially LY908 Warhawks which were unstealthed and often used to bait out air defenses. The fallen would die praying, but fall they would.<div style="float: right;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qwWBgO7.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div><br><br>Once tangled up in the sky however the Marshites would find comfort. The MAF-50 was a hyper agile and advanced light fighter and cut through the skies cleanly and swiftly while its advanced avionics and weapons paired for defensive and offensive purpose alike. The MAF-50S would pick and choose where and what to do. Some flights targeted anti-air defenses while others waded into crushing air combat, and many others took the opportunity to target the base with their payloads. The Shadowhawks took aim at only the most important of aerial targets while the Warhawks pursued their targets with unrelenting aggression, pissed off avatars of violence in dashing form. The few bombers stayed out of the melee and only went on an attack run when there was an opening, or otherwise would leave. Support, though slow to arrive, was begrudgingly increased as the battle in the skies continued. <br><br>Marshite forces were not the only forces in the counterattack. Just as the Marshite fleets began to fire, so did the CFA fleets. One of the Ice drones was shot right at its roof, before having its back windows smashed. It was still functional, but severely damaged. Two more of the Ice drones were also hit; the first helicopter was entirely penetrated from back to front, and the second helicopter had one of its rotary wings completely smashed off. The Marshite forces too managed to destroy numerous aircraft; amounting to nine of fourty.<br><br>The Ice fleets were focused on targetting both Marshites and the CFA forces; but their priority was the Marshite forces. Yet, the few CFA vessels they targetted indeed suffered heavy damage; six of the 32 CFA aircraft were entirely destroyed, falling straight to the ground. Six more suffered heavy damage, damaged in the most critical of places.<br><br>The Ice fleets still suffered severe damage. The next round of firing caused seven Ice drones to bite the dust, while eight also suffered heavy damage. The Ice fleets were running out of time, however. Simoultaneously, twenty warheads were dropped upon Cruxhampton. Twenty, which were ready to consume the city in flames at any instant.<br><br>The CFA forces were not oblivious. And so, CFA forces carefully aimed their weapons to the falling warheads. Indeed, they simoultaneously fired. Ten of the Ice missiles burnt themselves up in the sky, or their contents simply blew into the air, by way of the projectiles sent to them by the CFA vessels; four also suffered heavy damage in various forms, but remained intact for the moment.<br><br>Meanwhile, over the city itself, several of the MAF-50 fighters had been on anti-drone duty and then switched to anti-missile when the launches were detected. Using their battlespace network they coordinated with one another to deduce the best pattern of movement and attack to achieve the best results possible when trying to take down the missiles before they detonated. The aircraft were fast, the missiles accurate, the electronics sublime- but time was time and there was no doubt not everything would be saved.<br><br>However, three fire missiles had already hit the ground, in time for the Ice States to return fire on the CFA forces, taking down two more vessels. The result? The devastation of most of Northern Cruxhampton; yet the survival of most of the rest of the city. In total, the attack took the lives of 192 civilians in Cruxhampton. Another 148 suffered heavy injuries; most of whom were delivered to the nearby Cruxhampton Hospital. But one thing was for certain: The sovereignty of Cruxhampton's airspace remained in the joint hands of the CFA and Holy Marsh.<br><br>It took about half an hour more for CFA land forces to arrive, who were shipped off to the city via airplane. Due to the inherent danger of presence in the city with the intended firebombings, there were no Ice guards in Cruxhampton at the time; and the Ice States was yet to organise a response. For the time being, the city of Cruxhampton was now in the sovereignty of the CFA.</div>

<div class="content"><div style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px"><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...hours after the Marshite intervention in the south Cruxhamptom.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">QUITIRUZ&#218;, SATRAPY OF NICARO</span></span><br><br>The Marshite intervention in Cruxhampton sent the alarm bells ringing from Nicaro to Arras. While Holy Marsh and the Golden Throne were generally aligned, even when it concerned TIS, there was some fear that if the empire reacted too slowly it would lose the opportunity to protect its economic interests. The source of these fears was twofold. First, the Marshite war machine would undoubtedly conclude the situation quickly. Second, it was unknown how the new regime &#8212; and with a Marshite intervention there <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be a new regime &#8212; would align with the Golden Throne, whether it would cooperate with the empire on the repayment of debts accrued by the TIS imperial government, and whether it would continue to cooperate on frontier security. It had already been decided that, in the event of this very scenario, the Fuermak would conduct a military intervention of its own.<br><br><div style="float: right;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PeSblBi.png" alt="Image"></div>The bulk of the two mechanized corps that had deployed into TIS during the Czaslyudian conflict moved <span style="font-style: italic">back across</span> the Nicaroan-Icean Frontier. Thousands of IFVs and APCs, escorted by heavily armored and large-caliber Nak&#237;l tanks, moved in columns into the province of Ormont. On the western flank, they would continue into parts of the Oldwitch province but these mechanized columns would not be moving too deeply into the Ice States. Rather, their function was to occupy and secure the northern cities, putting them under temporary Macab&#233;an martial law. This area would be known as the Icean Green Zone.<br><br>As the imperial armored columns charged southward, the skies overhead were filled with the black shapes of combat aircraft. These were a combination of Lu-45 Hawks and AEJ-36 Seraphs belonging to the Laerihans, as well as GLI-34s flown by Kr&#237;ermada airmen. Their purpose was more so to intimidate but were also poised to interfere with any potential Icean resistance through close air support and general interdiction.<br><br>An hour prior to the intervention, codenamed Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, a secure cable was sent to Icean Emperor Sotolo II. It contained a short message inviting him to flee to the Icean Green Zone but heavily encouraging him to flee to the Macab&#233;an mainland instead. The Marshites would want his head and, if he remained in the capital, chances were that he would be captured. The Golden Throne could not guarantee his protection against imprisonment or, worse, execution unless he fled into imperial custody. Finally, the cable extended light guarantees against extradition back to to the Ice States or Holy Marsh, should those governments require as much. Notably, that protection was not extended to the Divine Scribe. The Macab&#233;an knowledge was that the Divine Scribe was the perfect scapegoat. Let his head roll for what had happened. Neither did the cable mention that the Divine Scribe was not allowed to flee to territory held by the Golden Throne. Let him come. If the Marshites requested it, he would be extradited.<br><br>Simultaneous with the launching of Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, a pre-written public announcement was circulated to the relevant governments and media outlets. It read:<br><br>"By order of His Imperial Majesty Fedor I, the Fuermak has commenced Operation NORTHERN FREEZE. NORTHERN FREEZE is a police action aimed at securing a limited portion of northern Ice States. The Icean military is recommended to either surrender to the Fuermak or withdraw southward. Imperial forces are instructed to remain peaceful unless fired upon. The civil administration of the secured territory will be temporarily suspended. All security will be provided for by the Fuermak, first by the regulares currently moving in and ultimately by limikari forces that will soon follow southward. This secured area will be known as the Icean Green Zone. Crucially, the sovereignty of this territory will not be in dispute. The Icean Green Zone remains Icean territory under the temporary administration of the Golden Throne. Furthermore and finally, peaceful civilian protests will not be intervened against, although we recommend that all Icean civilians temporarily head indoors and allow the situation to resolve itself. His Imperial Majesty Fedor I pledges that all Icean citizens living in the Icean Green Zone will be extended the civil rights and freedoms extended to all peoples of the Golden Throne. These rights and freedoms extend to all current-status slaves within the Icean Green Zone, who are emancipated effective immediately. All Iceans without employment are encouraged to reach out to Macab&#233;an officials who will be setting up work fronts throughout the Icean Green Zone to coordinate employment opportunities."<br><br>What was not mentioned were the ulterior motives. Primarily, a secured northern zone would protect the area where most of the current trade flows between the Golden Throne and the Ice States were concentrated in. Given the amount of capital that had been invested by the Imperial Bureaucracy into the expansion of Quitiruz&#250;'s port and administrative areas, and the volume of people who had migrated to the Quitiruz&#250; area in search of work, protecting its raison d'&#234;tre was absolutely vital. The Imperial Bureaucracy could not afford major losses in its public investments and, more so, it could not afford any social unrest related to the disruption of new work opportunities in a part of its empire already suffering from an anti-imperial insurgency. It was also expected that millions of refugees would travel north into the relative security of the Icean Green Zone. These refugees would be able to find work there and contribute to the consumption of Macab&#233;an goods.<br><br>Secondarily, the Icean Green Zone would invariably act as a form of collateral that the Golden Throne would hold against any future Icean regime to guarantee the repayment of the large loans it had made to the Sotolo government during the Czaslyudian conflict. Thirdly, control of the Icean territory across the Nicaroan frontier would allow the Golden Throne to continue limiting the movement of the aforementioned Nicaroan guerrillas, avoiding any disruption to current counterinsurgency operations seeking to limit the operational space and ultimately eradicate the insurgent threat.<br><br>While the second Macab&#233;an military intervention in the Ice States unfolded, another secured and private cable was sent to the Marshite embassy in Fedala, the imperial embassy in Holy Marsh, as well as directly to the Marshite government. It gave precise information on Macab&#233;an intentions, as well as exact data on the geographic limits to the Macab&#233;an intervention. Finally, it asked whether the Golden Throne could cooperate further with Holy Marsh in any way, although it expressed an understanding that the Marshites undoubtedly had the situation handled.<br><br>Another cable was sent to the Mokan embassy in Fedala and the Macab&#233;an embassy in Mokastana with similar information, but more so focused on policy regarding the temporarily expanded border between the Macab&#233;an satrapy of Nicaro and the Mokan federal state of Motokata. In essence, the Golden Throne sought to communicate its intentions and avoid any unnecessary confusion that could otherwise concern the Mokans of Macab&#233;an intentions.</div></div>

This is especially problematic considering that the occupied area includes Deephedge, in which the national justice system is administered, as well as the fact that the military administration is obstructing enforcement of belief in Klyprer, the one true deity.<br><br>Further, the occupation is a breach of the Treaty of Liberation, which had been agreed upon by our nations in 1414; in particular, Section 1 of Article III: "Neither signatory may perform...military...hostilities against the other signatory"; as well as the Golden Throne's pledge that it would "accept the legitimacy of the divine-favoured regime of the Empire of The Ice States" as made as part of its application for an embassy at Magecastle. Accordingly, we demand that the Golden Throne, without undue delay, withdraw from the Green Zone and return the right to administration of the occupied territories to the Ice States.<br><br>Should this fail, we will be forced to invoke Section 1 of Article IV in the Treaty of Liberation, which would also null the Ice States' currents debts towards the Golden Throne under the treaty, including the ongoing process of the abolition of slavery, as well as the repayment of Dienbank's loans to the Ice States. In addition, Macabean forces will be met with deadly force should they remain occupying any part of the Ice States.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Jeramy Vliet,<br>Duke of Magecastle,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.<br><br>~Sotolo II,<br>Emperor,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.<br><br>~Lionel Burkes,<br>General of the Ice Military,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.<br><br>~Klyprer,<br>Lord of the Cosmos,<br>With behalf of the Chief Scribe,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.</span></blockquote><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Cruxhampton, The Ice States.</span><br><br>The Ice forces had begun to attempt to lay siege upon the city to remove the CFA forces which had occupied the city. The entire city had indeed been surrounded by Ice forces; while the Ice forces continued battling with the CFA in the skies above. Yet, the CFA forces would not budge. It was, indeed, Ice vessels which fell to the ground as they were fired upon by the CFA; not the other way around.<br><br>It was not like the CFA was dealign with this alone either. Cruxhamptonians provided vital support to the CFA forces present in Cruxhampton; the Cruxhamptonians would harass and generally fuck with the Ice forces laying siege on the city, to such a degree effectively making their job insufferable. Indeed, this severely demoralised the Ice forces.<br><br>However, it came at a cost to Cruxhamptonian lives, with eight being killed by the Ice forces in response to their insubordination. The CFA thus ordered Cruxhamptonians to cease their harassment of Ice forces, instead encouraging them to enlist with the CFA. And this was certainly successful. The combined force managed to bring about the full removal of the siege struction on the city; yet the battle would continue to rage on. It was only until over a week later that Ice forces would surrender themselves to the CFA in Cruxhampton; and at that point they were facing a far greater threat from what had begun in Southport City, and would shape the outcome of the war more than anything else: the March of July.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;">(Ooc: This post may be expanded to describe the further progress of the March.)</span><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2y9inP4CqE" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Aladdin Sane.</a><br><br><div style="float: left;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lRMEoqG.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City, The Ice States.</span><br><br>The military administration in the city was simply dealing in another regular weekend night: indeed, they were just called to address a shoplifting in the city, just as the military base in the city caught fire. It turned out, it was being bombed from the sky, and at night it would not be easy to respond.<br><br>Immediately, two AI units flew to defend the base, firing upon the warheads as they fell. But it was already too late. In a matter of minutes, the entire base was burned down to the ground, into ash. But this would not be sufficient for the CFA -- indeed, their mission was to seize the entire area from Southport City up to Cruxhampton.<br><br>The CFA not only had land soldiers tasked with invasion of the city; but also an air force which deployed to back the land forces. In a matter of minutes, the land forces were confronted by the Ice military. Bloodshed ensued; of 39 CFA soldiers present, three were lost just in this one confrontation. Yet, the Ice military had effectively ceded control of the city, just as it had in Cruxhampton. The CFA maintained full authority over the city now.<br><br>Reinforcements -- consisting of 80 additional land personnel, along with nine airships -- were promptly deployed to Southport City to maintain control. However, the 39 CFA soldiers, along with their air fleets, continued onwards. Before they reached their next destination, they were already joined by five armed civilians just from the mission in Southport City, along with reinforcements of fifty new personnel. The tactic was to deliver new personnel as the march continued, to replace those lost or unable to continue.<br><br>Contrary to the name, the March did not, however, involve physical walking from one destination to the next, but rather movement in protective military tanks. Surprisingly, they, in fact, received little pushback across the journey from the Ice military. In any case, their mission was easily well-received by those who it sought to protect: they had, once again, gained five new recruits from Southport City, while the inhabitants of Cruxhampton could owe their lives to the CFA, as well as the neighbouring unbeliever nation of Holy Marsh.<br><br>The March would continue.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Some place between Southport City and Valenpool, The Ice States.</span><br><br>The CFA, as they progressed through the March, remained in the occupied areas, establishing a new military administration. Through rural areas to small towns, and throughn occasional skirmishes with the Ice forces, the March was undoubtedly going well at this point. However, the Ice military was far more organised than to simply ignore the invasion of much of its sovereign territory. It would meet the CFA wherever possible. It had to ensure the establishment of the Communal Union of the Ice States cease permanently.<br><br>That was when a warhead fell straight from the sky. Turns out, the civilian airplanes visible were not civilian airplanes; they were disguised Ice aircraft deployed to take down the CFA threat. Hordes of soldiers too appeared on foot. Even someone's farm in the middle of Southport would turn into a warzone. Not that it would matter much. For Klyprer, Conquest, and Riches.<br><br>And suddenly, the odds were not in the favour of the CFA. It was not the Ice deployment who were effectively a militia squad. The CFA, too, was outnumbered about 3:2. Onto the ground fell both vessels and persons, both Ice and CFA.<br><br>As to what actually happened, however, it was not as simple. Up above, the remotely-controlled Ice drones fared very poorly against the CFA's manually operated aircraft. The Icers would have been fighting not for the Ice States, but for their own lives, had they been at the scene; but they were not. Back in Southport City, many did not even realise what was happening to their vessels as they collapsed onto the ground.<br><br>Meanwhile, in land it was a far less one-sided struggle. The Ice tanks were shot by the CFA tanks, and vice versa. The few Icers who were acting individually too were bleeding onto the grass on the battlefield, which had turned completely crimson from the struggle's incredible death toll, on both sides.<br><br>After nearly two hours of fighting, air support was the only real way that the CFA could win this: after all, the CFA already maintained decisive control over the airspace above, and indeed only three Ice drones actually remained.<br><br>And therefore, air support came. The CFA ostensibly retreated from the battlezone in a matter of minutes. They continued being fired upon, but only fired in self-defense. It appeared as if the Icers was going to win. As they were about to celebrate, however, what happened would entirely prevent Ice victory in this occasion.<br><br>The CFA vessels began delivering explosive weaponry upon the battlefield where the Ice forces were concentrated. This did not come at no loss to the CFA -- two personnel who had failed to retreat in time were blown up by the mission. However, the targets -- and victims -- were first and foremost the Icers. They were almost entirely removed by the attack; and even the Ice vessels' attempts to remove the CFA craft and shoot down the bombs administered unto the site, were futile. The CFA had gained victory writ large in this battle; and the burden was no longer on the CFA to defeat the Empire, but on the Empire to defeat the CFA. It was clear that the Empire and Ice military had to up their game to win this battle; but in war, there was no time for the CFA to celebrate their victory. The March of July would go on, until "Freedom For All" would be achieved.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata City, Motokata <br>People's Unified Federation</span> <br><br>With the Marshites starting an, unexpectedly small, air campaign in The Ice States, and the Golden Throne attempting to occupy the North of the country, the question of Federal involvement in the uprising had come up. Trade between the two nations was closed, with the Motokatan border militarized but open to refugees. The State Holder of Motokata petitioned the Federal Security Council and Heads of State council for emergency supplies, as they expected refugees to flow across the border if the fighting continued. What had started as a simple border crossing issue was turning into a major international incident. Already there was talk of sending the traitor back, not to mend relations with the Ice States, but to wash Federal hands of the situation. While others were ready to join the Marshites in the removal of a dangerous pariah state from Greater Dienstad.<br><br>Unfortunately, being a democratic institution, the PUF had certain limitations on how they could intervene. The unification treaty between Motokata and the PUF allowed Motokata to act offensively, but only if they were attacked first. A trade sanction was not an attack. So instead they would have to wait for the Federal Senate to decide on a course of action, be it a declaration of war by a two thirds vote, or other limited responses. <br><br>However, there was one tool Motokata could use to help destabilize the hostile regime on their border, the PUF's Villa Doctrine. A policy created since Mokastana was itself a former colony and occupied nation, that it is the moral duty of the People's Unified Federation to aid and arm popular uprisings and rebellions, in the name of self determination. In practice they were actually very selective about who they armed, but it also meant the Motokatans could act without needing to get Federation approval.<br><br>With Southport City under occupation of the Communist Freedom Army, it meant there was a safe port of entry. A squadron of MGV-02 Warbeach Ekranoplanes took off from southern Motokata towards Southport city. The planes flew south, staying in Marshite air space as they flew east, until they turned north over the uncontrolled lands where they did their best to stay low. Once they were over the ocean they switched to Ground Effect. Where the planes would "fly" only meters off the ground at hundreds of kilometers an hour. With luck,they would make it to Southport City undetected and unload weapons and missiles for the rebels to utilize. If detected, the Warneaches had cruise missiles armed to defend themselves, but they would abort if things got to dangerous. To counter that, Damocles kept track of Ice States Forces, and the PUF Navy was moving a Carrier group around the Marshite Islands towards The Ice States. Hopefully being a distraction for whoever was watching the southern coast. <br><br>If all went according to plan, the following weapons would be dropped off on the coastline near Southport:<br><br>480x AM-07 Battle Rifles, an older Mokan combat rifle firing the large 7.62x54r round semi automatically with 20 round magazines.<br><br>160x Javier. 45 caliber submachine guns. An amalgamation of plastic, aluminum and steel based on a hundred year old machine gun. It came with 20 round mags and could be used for urban or ambush combat.<br><br>192x LD-1 disposable rocket launchers. Although not able to destroy main battle tanks, they could certainly ruin APCs or structures. <br><br>36x MA-14 missile launchers and 216 HEAT top attack missiles, for infantry to fight main battle tanks.<br><br>24x 60mm &#8216;Dropper&#8217; mortars, designed to drop two shells on a target in rapid succession, very useful in hit and run attacks.<br><br>10x LY60 Machine Guns. The large 14.7mm rounds would be great at defense and light vehicle countering.</div>

<div class="content">The hours after the Marshite involvement in the Ice States were silent from the Arch-Bishop. In previous administrations, foreigners could easily chalk it up to the general bemusement Marshites hadwith anything involving public relations or non-necessary communications. After all, why bother saying you were at war if you were already bombing the enemy? Seemed a waste of time. of course, this was not the normal Marshite administration and Luboski's silence was telling. More so was the fate of the groups of the 8-2-4 that participated. The planes were escorted back by four whole Air Wings and the pilots and records were whisked away. All three Groups were replaced in administration even before they landed, and were in the midst of being resupplied even as the previous groups were vanished. Multiple AI worked to scrub all communication records in an unusually violent and aggressive manner. Because of this it was hard to estimate Marshite losses, though it was known at least six aircraft failed to return- perhaps more.<br><br>There was no immediate secondary action. Several Air Crusades were placed on ready position while Naval Forces and Army personnel previously called to their positions did so. Still, there was not the customary overwhelming Marshite attack wave. No announcement imemdiately of a call to Crusade, and the whole action was silenced from being broadcast in Holy Marsh itself.<br>It would be later that evening that the Marshites would respond to the cables sent to them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">"From the Desk of the Arch-Bishop to the Sona Emperor Fedor:<br><br>Honored Fedor, Chosen of His Lineage!<br>Marshite forces acted earlier today in order to prevent a further genocide of the People of the Ice States. We do not currently plan to launch any additional attacks, though we are preparing for a general military operation in the near future. For the moment, we are willing to aid the brave rebels of the CFA and other anti-regime forces and will intervene more directly if they call for it or we sense it is the only way to prevent a wider genocide from being enacted. We acknowledge your own interests and shall respect the boundaries of your occupation. If needed, we shall engage in your defense as well. <br><br>I have sent to your military leaders the current Marshite disposition and force allocation, as well as various plans of attack. I will inform you that the Holy Warriors are considering declaring Marks* on certain figures, the Emperor included. We will also be offering rewards for the death or capture of certain figures as well. <br><br>May the Holy Marsh Bless Your Days And Family,<br>Arch-Bishop Luboski, Speaker of the Faith<br><br>Thought for the Day: Faith Determines Character"</span><br><br>*Marks are the official term for the Holy Warrior process of selecting targets for assassination. Once applied, Marks are never removed and travel via bloodline- Marks thousands of years old are still actively pursued by Holy Warriors. <br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>As time rolled by, the Theocracy continued to gather its forces. In a few days, it had moved all of its vastness into position and ready to make a move, but steadied itself as per the Arch-Bishop's orders. As the CFA continued its fight, M-SAD would do what it could to help. Agents would liaison with their military and command forces and give them access to the vast military intelligence apparatus of the Romani-Mar'si Union, with the several dozen thousand satellites of DAMOCLES and AI-assisted SACHERI Battlespace Networks providing critical edges, along with the ceaseless efforts of HUMINT and SIGINT. The CFA was also given a blank check monetarily and given in-roads for quick access to war materials and equipment. They would also work with the People's United Federation on her efforts, in order to create a stronger foundation of support for the CFA and what was bound to follow.</div>

<div class="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns2hmyP0mGY" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Loving the Alien.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Valenpool, The Ice States</span><br><br>And the most decisive battle of the civil war yet was to occur now. Indeed, the battle of Valenpool was now imminent.<br><br>The city -- which was home to the Duchy of Valenpool, which govered construction services -- was notable for its complex terrain. It effectively has two halves, split by the Valenpool river; the Western half is the largest and most urbanised, while the Eastern half is a largely rural area, which is also home to the legendary Valenpool caves. North of the city, is Mt. Valenpool, from which the Valenpool river flows.<br><br>Valenpool, by virtue of being a government city, was heavily militarised; yet, its main military base was at the Western coast of the Valenpool river. An invasion would not be easy -- it would have to depend on an air attack.<br><br><div style="float: left;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h1jc70g.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div>The CFA had a greater opportunity for a surprise attack; but any element of surprise would be severely harmed by the public knowledge that the March was ongoing. The only way for a surprise attack to be feasible would be if the CFA fleets could hide in the least visible places possible. And there was only one location in Valenpool that this would be possible: the Valenpool caves. Some of the caves were well-guarded, but others were effectively out in the open. The latter were the ones that were to be exploited by the CFA.<br><br>Dragging their equipment to the caves and promptly hiding in the most concealed locations therein was reasonably simple for the land forces. However, the air forces were far more handicapped in this regard. Going into the airspace at Valenpool would not be easy without being caught. To keep the element of surprise, a faux retreat was needed; even when air attack would be essential to claiming victory.<br><br>And so the CFA airplanes drove back, but not directly to Southport City. Instead, they stationed themselves in various locations north of Southport, while some did indeed remain in Southport City's airspace. This was necessary if only to ensure that the airspace did not fall into the wrong hands, even with the fleets which remained in the occupied areas. A secured communication was promptly sent to the commanders of the CFA units stationed in the areas to which new units would be sent _<br><br>"CFA airplanes will be stationed throughout the areas occupied by the CFA already, excluding Cruxhampton. This will be done to prevent occupied airspace from falling into the wrong hands, and assist in any land missions where needed; as well as to disguise the operation in Valenpool to occur imminently. They shall return to Valenpool when CFA land forces have begun to seize the land therein; all commanders of CFA units stationed in the occupied zone will be informed prior to such departure. Please do not obstruct the entry of the new CFA airplanes."<br><br>And so the battle began.<br><br>The CFA soldiers first and foremost targetted the Ice security forces present in the area. Overall, there were few Ice security forces in the East of Valenpool. Given how rural and depopulated it was, this was little surprise. In a matter of hours, the entire East came under the sovereignty of the CFA. And around this time, it was ready for reinforcements to arrive...<br><br>Another short message was wired to the fleets stationed at the occupied areas. It read as follows _<br><br>"As the invasion of Valenpool has begun, the Ice fleets previously stationed shall deploy to Valenpool. Please do not obstruct their exit."<br><br>Promptly, CFA airplanes indeed exited the area, travelling to Valenpool. Yet, the Valenpool airplanes would face the most significant challenge in the battle: attacks from the Ice air units. The CFA fleets were thus indeed shot down in part by the Ice fleets; and the Ice States was winning in its airspace battle. It was a 37v24 combat, with the CFA already being outnumbered. Even then, the Ice fleets had lost only two ships, while the CFA had lost seven. Yet, the CFA had an advantage in the East: The CFA fleets were concentrated there, while the Ice fleets were concentrated in the West.<br><br>Action needed to be taken urgently. And so, the air attack of the land began. The CFA fleets had received the missile launchers and top attack missiles delivered by the PUF, which had been transported from Southport over to the Marching fleets in the aftermath of the battle that was faced earlier by the CFA. And these weapons -- very useful weapons -- were now to be put to use by the Ice fleets.<br><div style="float: right;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S7TRUmj.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div><br>Immediately, five cyllindrical objects each fell from five of the CFA airplanes. Where were they to go? The Ice military base in Valenpool. Nigh-simoultaneously, they emitted a bright flame as they flew down across the river, to the military base. And this was a surprise attack. The Ice fleets had little time to respond against the attack, such that only one counter-missile could be accurately launched, and that was because that counter-missile was launched by an AI, rather than any human. One of the military base's automatic defense system did it. Only one other launch was made by a human in time, and it missed. Drastically.<br><br>And with one of the CFA missiles shot down, and another missing, the Valenpool military base was shot by three missiles. This caused severe damage, but the Ice airbase was still functioning in many parts. The automatic defense system was nigh-dysfunctional, and could only defend against attacks from a very particular range. That range was not where the CFA was attacking from.<br><br>What this did cause, however, was that the surprise of missile launches was destroyed. The Ice fleets more enthusiastically attacked the CFA fleets, causing the CFA to lose much control over the area. A larger stream of air-to-surface missiles was launched by the CFA, but only two -- of seven -- made it this time. There was greater precision, since the CFA was no longer rushed to conceal that the missiles were to be launched, but it was FAR easier to shoot down the missiles now.<br><br>The base was now consumed in flames, almost in its entirety. It was destroyed. Well, nigh-destroyed. What little of the base remained indeed turned into ash. Yet, the military base was nowhere near the sole group harmed. The CFA had hit collateral damage -- or what was thought as such. Most of the missiles which missed the base harmlessly fell into the Valenpool river; but one hit right in a residential centre -- directly in a house. And not just any house. A wooden house. The entire civilian zone was soon too damaged; and eight individuals -- civilian individuals -- were seized by the fire. Regardless of whether it was malice or mere neglience, those who were purported to be protected by the CFA came dead at the hands of the same.<br><br>Then the Ice fleets were determined not to allow the CFA to win this game; even if they had already destroyed their base. And simoultaneously, a stream of missiles erupted from the Ice ships. This alone took down twelve CFA fleets; leaving less than half of the original 24 deployed by the CFA to Valenpool.<br><br>Not even one CFA soldier had stepped foot in Western Valenpool yet, as they were waiting for the CFA to seize the airspace; and the outcome on that end seemed definite; as did the outcome in the East, even if it was the opposite to in the West. The sole way the CFA could survive, would be if it retreated solely to the East, therein keeping sovereignty over the zone while ignoring the West.<br><br>One-by-one, airships belonging to the CFA evacuated the West of the city. The fire continued, but the CFA had far less ships to deal while focusing only on maintaining sovereignty in the East. The occasional bombing of the East by Ice fleets did little to stop this victory; Ice fleets were shot down one-by-one as they attempted to enter. <br><br>The Ice fleets would lose more ships did they continue. And so, Division Commander Nicholas Dellamore made an announcement to the Ice fleets.<br><br>"Attention Air Force Divisions 84 and 85. This is Commander Dellamore. Please retreat to Western Valenpool. Only return fire upon CFA fleets to defend our sovereignty in the West."<br><br>This worked as a magic spell as the Ice fleets left the East. The outcome was now clear; the Empire maintained the West, and the CFA maintained the East. The CFA's mission had, in part, failed: less persons were liberated from the Empire by virtue of the CFA's failure in the West; and the most important parts of Valenpool were lost. Yet, a clear benefit was also provided: the CFA had a strategic benefit in maintaining a free space through which CFA personnel could pass, and one which, by virtue of its geography, would be very easy to be maintained in a militarised state as by the CFA.<br><br>The March would go on, of course. But not immediately. More CFA fleets were promptly delivered to the airspace of Eastern Valenpool, maintaining the zone's security. Yet, there were no formal attempts to overthrow the new regime in Eastern Valenpool by the Ice States; the most that there was were small, localised rebellions which were easily quashed by the CFA deployment.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City, The Ice States.</span><br><br>A secured message was sent directly to the leadership of the People's United Federation and Holy Marsh surrounding events in Valenpool _<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">To: [PUF and Marshite governments]<br>From: The Communist Freedom Army of the Ice States<br><br>To whom it may concern.<br><br>The Communist Freedom Army (CFA) in the Ice States has recently participated in a conflict in the city of Valenpool with the Ice military. This battle is a continuation of a long-term operation by the CFA to seize much of the East of the Ice States, facilitating future attempts to eventually topple the genocidal, corrupt, and theocratic Empire. The battle resulted in the CFA successfully seizing the East of Valenpool, a ruralised zone with little population yet a complex geography. However, the West of Valenpool remains in Ice hands, and the Ice fleets repelled our attempted liberation of the West as to force the CFA to retreat to the East, while the Ice fleets retreated to the West.<br><br>We would like to request that [recipient nation] assist in the seizure of Western Valenpool. As you likely know, the CFA is a small, irregular force, and we believe that a nation such as yourself would be the best which can assist in our efforts to overthrow the current regime in Western Valenpool. Yet, should [recipient nation] accept this offer, we will provide military forces and equipment to support your efforts.<br><br>Signed,<br>~The Communist Freedom Army.</blockquote><br><br>The CFA had also planned to send a copy of this message to the Golden Throne too, once it was informed of its response to the Ice demand for the cessation of Operation NORTHERN FREEZE. Should the Golden Throne continue in Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, the CFA would seek aid from the Golden Throne in seizing Western Valenpool.<br><br><sub>(Ooc: Post edited to fix a misspelling, then to fix BBCode in this disclaimer.)</sub></div>

She was at the Palacio de las Cortes de Nicaro, the congressional building that hosted the satrapy's bicameral legislature, waiting in a dressing room awaiting her cue to enter the senate's chamber. Lara was to give a speech on the imperial intervention in the Ice States and what it meant for Nicaroan security and prosperity, including and especially as it concerned the evolving situation in the southern sectors of the satrapy. There was nothing much riding on this speech, no vote, no allocation of local money, but four years had changed much in Nicaro and the local power structure was now more integrated with the Imperial Bureaucracy &#8212; the Cortes expected to be informed of imperial foreign policy that affected it and to be included, even if only in an illusory way, in that decision-making. Lara saw it as an opportunity to further enforce the new political hierarchy: that Nicaro was ruled by the Golden Throne, not as an occupied state, but as a fully integrated subject. Of course, it would take more than four years for the Nicaroans to truly believe that, but this was a start.<br><br>But now the speech was pushed to the side as she read the Marshite letter and silently cursed under her breath. She hadn't agreed with the decision, taken without her, to initiate the occupation of the northern Icen States. There was insufficient clarity, in her mind, for such an operation to be launched. Now it was obvious that Lara had been right. The Marshite intervention was little more than a limited military strike. There was no large-scale Marshite invasion of the Ice States planned. And now the Golden Throne was on its own, her armies occupying a significant swath of nominally allied territory under the pretense that it was protecting it from the general chaos overwhelming the rest of the country. That chaos, though, was not unfolding at the expected pace. Protesters were still filling the streets, the Icean government was still killing them in brutal fashion, and the country was still embroiled in an intensifying civil war, but the situation was more manageable for the Icean government than it had been when it was thought the Marshites were ready to knock it down. It made the Golden Throne look bad. Fedala would have to scramble to make up a new excuse for its intervention.<br><br>The door to the room opened and a Nicaroan attendant said, "Your Excellency, Los Caciques are ready for you."<br><br>Corte de Los Caciques is what the Nicaroan senate was known as. It was a chamber that claimed centuries worth of history, although it had not met for a very long time before the arrival of the Macab&#233;ans. The previous dictatorship had certainly not honored its traditions. But the Golden Throne had promised to replace right-wing dictatorship and left-wing revolution with a stable democracy in what was known then as Nicador and Firmador, and so it brought back the Corte de Los Caciques as the upper house of the satrapy's new democratic legislature. On the other side of the building met the Asembl&#237;a Popular, the legislature's lower house. As the more prestigious of the two, it was the Corte de Los Caciques in which representatives of the Imperial Bureaucracy addressed the Nicaroan legislature.<br><br>Nodding, Lara replied, "Thank you. You may lead me there."<br><br>The attendant bowed and then turned around to head back into the hall. Lara followed him down the corridor, around some corners, and then up a long staircase with gilded handrails. She appreciated the building's beauty. It had been renovated after Nicaro's liberation and was stamped by the hand of His Imperial Majesty Fedor throughout. At the end of the first staircase, sitting in a platformed recess carved into the back wall was a statue of Him made of marble. It showed Him in all His majesty, muscled, square-jawed, eyes following those that walked this staircase as if taking in His subjects as they presented themselves before Him. The statue served as a reminder of who was the true power in Nicaro, but matched with the opulence of the building it was also a reminder of who their greatest benefactor was. Fedor was not just the utmost authority, he was also their utmost ally and friend &#8212; like a father. That was how He wanted to be seen. Lara looked into those intense eyes as they passed the statue and then turned away to walk up the second flight of red-carpeted stairs. At the top were two wide dark-wood doors that were closed and manned by two lance-bearing guards, ceremonial gatekeepers to the Caciques' chambers. They opened the doors for her as she approached. No door in Nicaro was closed to a kr&#237;erlord, an authority second only to His Imperial Majesty Himself.<br><br>80 caciques &#8212; 40 from the Prefecture of Nicaro and 40 from the Prefecture of Firmador &#8212; stood and clapped as Kr&#237;erlord Lara Surr entered into their presence. They chanted, "Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor. Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor." They repeated these lines time and time again as she approached the platform in the center of the chamber, climbed atop it, and rose her arms to hush them. She never tired of the ceremony.<br><br>"Caciques of Nicaro, your emperor salutes you!" They thundered back in applause.<br><br>"This morning the armed forces of the Golden Throne launched Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, a carefully planned" &#8212; that was a lie &#8212; "military intervention in the Ice States. It was not an easy decision to come to, not least because of its implications with regard to Nicaroan security. Of course, Nicaroan security is the foremost concern of the Imperial Bureaucracy and Fuermak alike. It was our concern when we ejected the Ordenite Nazis from this land, as it was when we eradicated the pirates, private militias, and guerrillas that had spread chaos and death from Liberia to Managua. Thanks to Will, Fortune, and His Imperial Majesty, Nicaro now enjoys the beginning of an unprecedented era of security and peace. It is an era that we intend to maintain throughout His life and beyond. This responsibility on our shoulders was the primary motivation behind the Fuermak's intervention in the Ice States."<br><br>She paused for just a moment, then continued, "Criminal elements operating in the Prefecture of Nicaro have been known to cross into Icean territory. It is, of course, no coincidence that their primary area of operation is directly across this frontier. Although we had thought to finally have reached a long-lasting solution via TOICAF, the government with which we signed that agreement has proven less stable and capable than we had originally considered. We now believe that this government has inadequately pursued its side of the agreement, not out of viciousness or purposeful deceit but simply out of incapacity. There is strong evidence linking the southern guerrillas with rebel military action in TIS itself. Whether these Nicaroan guerrilleros and TIS rebels are the same organization is a question that present intelligence cannot answer, but that they are related in some way and that the guerrilleros seek to destabilize our southern neighbors as a means of securing themselves a base from which to launch attacks in Nicaroan territory is beyond question. Therefore, the Imperial Bureaucracy has determined that there is no other course of action than to occupy portions of northern TIS and secure it against all rebel action. If the imperial Icean government cannot uphold its side of TOICAF, the Fuermak will guarantee the security of all Nicaroans itself. Our dedication to peace and stability within Nicaro is unwavering and knows no bounds."<br><br>The chamber once again roared in applause. Out of the corner of her eye, Lara caught Satrap Gustavo Sabat&#233; at his throne-like seat, at once equal with the rest of the assembly but nevertheless elevated within its own space. He applauded too, like the rest of them. But she could tell a subtle uneasiness within him as if he were just now realizing how permanent the Golden Throne intended its authority in Nicaro to be. Sabat&#233; was the emperor's chosen man, but the integration of Nicaro into the imperial federation had been too recent for there to be a truly loyal Nicaroan in government. Sabat&#233;'s thinly veiled expression was a reminder of that. Lara turned back to the crowd of caciques.<br><br>"No Nicaroan blood will be spilled in this intervention, I personally guarantee that," she said to them. It was true. While Nicaroans were being enrolled into the ranks of the Fuermak, their blood would be spilled on other battlefields. "Operation NORTHERN FREEZE will be initially conducted by imperial regulares and then the responsibility of administration and policing will be passed on to the limikari. None of these bodies of personnel will include Nicaroan citizens. Too much Nicaroan blood has been spilled already. But those civil wars and insurgencies are now over thanks to Will, Fortune, and His Imperial Majesty. The blood and glory of Nicaro will see an unprecedented revival thanks to this unprecedented era of security and peace, an era which is further solidified thanks to Operation NORTHERN FREEZE." Again, the crowd erupted in thunderous applause.<br><br>A chant was raised again. "Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor. Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor. "Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor. Glory to Her Excellency. Glory to the Golden Throne. Glory to the emperor." On and on they went, for as long as she let them. Then, after they had prostrated themselves to her liking, Lara raised her arms to huh them. And like dogs before their master, they did.<br><br>She continued her speech, moving on to other topics: newly announced urban construction projects, land reform like that seen in Zarbia and Nuevo Le&#243;n, changes in the justice code as it regarded guerrilla prisoners, and other things. Nicaro was a satrapy at a nascent stage of its evolution, there was still much to do, a lot to change, and plenty to accomplish in this land before it could be <span style="font-style: italic">truly</span> considered just another Macab&#233;an appendage.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">FEDALA, IMPERIAL PROVINCE, THE GOLDEN THRONE</span></span><br><br>Much like Lara Surr, Fedor and his entourage read both the Icean and Marshite cables somberly. They had realized their misjudgment. The Marshites were not yet intervening in the conflict in full force, meaning the Icean imperial government was not as close to collapse as the Imperial Bureaucracy had anticipated. Operation NORTHERN FREEZE had been launched too early. It was no longer an intervention on the cusp of political collapse. Rather, it was an occupation of land still more-or-less firmly in imperial Icean control. That complicated the situation considerably. But a decision to intervene had been made and now the consequences of that decision had to be accepted.<br><br>Fedor penned a response to the Iceans Himself and within the hour of receiving the message, dedicating it to his equal and not the other signatories on the cable,<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">Sotolo II,<br><br>It is with the utmost displeasure that I find myself writing this to you. My decision to intervene in your country was not made lightly. Nor was it made against your interests. The opposite, in fact. Your welfare and the continuation of your legacy are my utmost motivators. Your country is falling apart. Large swaths of territory are being taken over by rebels. And, much worse, these rebels command the sympathies of foreign powers such as Holy Marsh and Mokastana. I fear for you and your government. It is out of this fear that my military's operation in your country is borne. It is imperative that you understand this because it's with your safety in mind that I must reject your demand for my military's withdrawal from your country.<br><br>Know that this operation is not an act of war against your state. It is not hostility and therefore not a breach of the terms of our agreement. Rather, our operation will guarantee that a significant portion of your country does not fall into chaos and into the hands of rebels. Our operation will also give you a safe haven as more of your country falls into rebel hands and, more importantly, as foreign powers seek to overthrow you from power. I encourage you find refuge behind my army. Indeed, I encourage you to fly to Fedala, where I have made a palace ready for you.<br><br>I beseech you to command your troops to stand down against mine. The last thing I intend is for your army to be massacred. I would rather you soldiers preserve their strength and their lives to prepare for your return, once the situation calls for it. But know that should your army open fire on mine, I will not hold mine back from doing what it needs to protect Macab&#233;an lives. You know as well as I do that the best course of action for your army is to withdraw from the Green Zone we are establishing. This is not a permanent occupation, merely a temporary solution to the instability spreading throughout the Ice States.<br><br>Finally, you must keep your cool. Your threats against me and my people are taken with no hard feelings...for now. I trust that you will still stay true to your word as far as your country's debt to mine. The same goes for your commitment to the emancipation of your slaves. Remember that the Golden Throne risked much to protect you and your state from military force. I recommend that you not only reiterate your commitment to the agreements you made but that you accelerate the realization of these commitments as a further gesture of goodwill. The current situation is very serious. And this time your potential enemy is not a minor power but a foremost Greater D&#237;enstadi political and military power.<br><br>I hope that our friendship continues for a long time to come but that friendship is now in your hands.<br><br>Best,<br><br>His Imperial Majesty Fedor I</blockquote><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">OPERATION NORTHERN FREEZE</span></span><br><br>The occupation of northern TIS proceeded as it had begun although its tone was beginning to shift. Although the Icean cable to the Macab&#233;an embassy was kept secret, new orders were quickly disseminated to commanders on the ground. They were instructed to be wary of the Icean military and to expect resistance in the coming hour. This new order manifested itself in various ways.<br><br>On the ground, the army opted to surround Icean military installations, roadblocks, and checkpoints if these were not abandoned. A distance was kept and the Macab&#233;ans were not the ones to initiate the violence, but sufficient armored and mechanized forces were left behind at these points to neutralize them if the Icean military decided to resist the occupation. In the air, the Laerihans aerial presence was no longer so ostentatious. There was now a confirmed threat of the possible intervention of Icean surface-to-air batteries and the Laerihans sought to minimize the exposure of its air forces. The maximum depth of aerial penetration was therefore restricted to a space limited by the front line itself. Macab&#233;an warplanes flew over territories where Macab&#233;an air defense systems were themselves amply available. This was coupled with an intensification of combat air patrols and an increase in the number of airborne early-warning drones and battlefield communication aircraft.<br><br>These modifications to the approach meant that the velocity of the southward advance necessarily slowed. But the Fuermak showed no intention of reversing its advance.</div></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;">(Ooc: ORBAT was updated with Macabees' consent to be roughly scaled to his deployment.)</span><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyaAPsT1LU" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Headlong.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Stonegrad, The Ice States.</span><br><br>A meeting had been called in the royal castle between General Lionel Burkes, the Emperor, the Divine Scribe, and all Colonels of the Ice military. The Duke of Magecastle was also present, but purely to deal with the diplomatic aspects of the discussion, as any response would, in no doubt, affect relations between the Ice States and the Golden Throne. The meeting had been called to discuss the occupation of Ormont, now that the Emperor received the message he did from the Golden Throne.<br><br>The Emperor was the first to speak. "As you undoubtedly know, the Empire of the Golden Throne -- of which we had previously been staunch allies -- opted to engage in an occupation of most of Ormont, as well as part of Oldwitch. This represents a grave violation of our sovereignty, and just today, after I asked them to so discontinue their occupation, they responded saying that it was in our interests to have this occupation."<br><br>With a few button presses on the part of the Emperor, the centre of the desk changed to an image of the message sent by the Golden Throne to the Emperor. The Emperor then continued. "I have not yet ordered a response or otherwise responded to their message." The Duke of Magecastle added, "I would also note that this occupation represents a grave breach of the Golden Throne's treaty duties to the Ice States, as it had promised in the Treaty of Liberation it would refrain from engaging in military hostilities; and had promised in its application for an embassy at Magecastle to recognise the sovereignty of the divinely-sanctioned Empire. I fully intend to terminate the treaty between The Golden Throne and the Ice States once the battle begins."<br><br>The Emperor then continued. "In any case, I have called this meeting to discuss -- and, in particular, for the General to determine -- how to respond to this. Lionel, you lead the meeting now." The General then nodded, and the Emperor sat down, before the General rose to speak. "What we have here, is a grave breach of our sovereignty which we must respond to immediately. I did not agree with the decision to allow this to be handled diplomatically, as there was no way that the Golden Throne were, in fact, to discontinue the occupation, as shown here. However, we must fix the mistakes we have already made."<br><br>With presses of a few buttons, the centre of the table again changed to a satellite image of Ormont, showing the occupied areas. The General continud speaking. "As you can see here, the Macabeans have set up various military bases throughout Ormont, and surrounding Ice military bases. In the air, they likewise have seized our airspace. Yet, they maintain minimal control over the seas. While the North-East of Ormont will be nigh-impossible to permeate due to the Quitiruzu base in Nicaro, the Golden Throne has occupied only naval ports; other parts of the seas remain entirely in Ice sovereignty."<br><br>"Yet, I believe it to be unwise to deploy naval forces to start the liberation of Ormont. This will give the Macabeans a broad ability to notice our attack. We need to surprise the Macabeans with our liberation of our territories. Likewise, we cannot engage in a liberation immediately. We need to wait five hours or so since the message to the Ice States before we can engage in any operation."<br><div style="float: right;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sNVHURE.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div><br>"I present Operation Blackseat, a scheme to liberate the territories of Ormont from control of the Golden Throne," continued the General, as the center of the desk again changed into a map of Ormont and the Macabean occupation thereof. "It will begin through emergency evacuation of all indoor sections of military bases in the relevant area which have been surrounded by the Golden Throne. Soldiers shall exit the bases by way of the emergency exit passages while fully armed for battle. The Macabeans will, of course, likely be award of their existence; but as they are wilfully concealed; and few appear to be covered by the Macabeans; those that are can be liberated by the Ice forces which did manage to exit. Then, they shall confront the Macabeans by surprise outside of the bases, holding greater freedom of movement than being stuck within their bases."<br><br>"In the air, airbases are barely -- if at all -- occupied, in a manner that did not remotely prevent launching of military aircraft from Ormontian bases, specifically in Wingcaster in and in Deephedge. These would engage in direct air-to-air combat to protect Ice airspace. They shall also receive surface-to-air support from ourdoor parts of Ice military bases; while these are largely occupied well, their liberation should too be relatively easy."<br><br>"Now, this mission shall begin through focused liberation of a small portion of Ormont. This shall be at the South of the areas currently occupied, and not directly at the Nicaroan border, as there will be a greater military presence from the Golden Throne's military presence at the border; yet, it shall still be towards the North of Ormont. This shall ensure strategic viability; the portion of Ormontian territories shall prevent further Macabean military equipment or personnel from travelling Southward." The General pointed to the brown portion on the map on the board, before continuing.<br><br>"Once this portion is fully secured, Ice forces shall move Northwardwrit large, while some will stay in the liberated areas to prevent them from falling into Macabean hands again. These shall then liberate further territories from Macabean hands north of the already-liberated territories Now, at this point our goal will be to coerce the Macabeans to surrender to the Empire. Yet, should this fail, the next stage of the liberation will commence: the liberation of the border territories. This will be a much more challenging struggle, but a necessary one."<br><br>"Both of these parts are also likely to be able to be completed in time. Yet, we will almost certainly also need further assistance to ensure that the final part succeeds. To that end, there are two things I propose. First, we will construct minefields surrounding the North and East of Logow, the North of Bannfolk, and the West of Deephedge. These will deter Macabean advances, along with the further militarisation of the area South and East of the occupied parts of the Green Zone. Secondly, this was proposed by Duke of Wintercourt, Nicholas Lucier: We shall conduct a cyberattack upon Macabean military properties in the Green Zone and Nicaro, should the Golden Throne still fail to surrender or otherwise cease the occupation."<br><br>"The Duchy of Wintercourt is indeed currently working on creating a virus which functions to shut down all computer systems operated by the Macabean military; or, more specifically, connected to Macabean military internet. Once it has infected all known Macabean military internet connections, or when ordered to directly by the Duchy of Wintercourt; with my and the Emperor's consent." The Emperor nodded in concurrence, as the General continued. "Now, shall the Colonels present any objections to the current plan for Operation Blackseat as I have explained?"<br><br>The first to speak was Colonel Robert Oursler. "This is, overall, a fantastic plan, and one which is needed. However, I find it to be a flawed idea to wait until all known Macabean military networks are infected before the virus begins to take effect. It would certainly take a long time for all to be infected; we should instead shut down targetted computers per 12 hours, for example." The Colonel Marcos Abendroth joined in agreement, rising to speak. "I concur with Oursler; otherwise, I have no objections to this plan."<br><br>After a brief period of hestiation, the General spoke. "It shall be so. I shall request that the Duke of Wintercourt ensure that the program instead shut down computers each 12 hours since the program's deployment. Any other objections to the plan for Operation Blackseat?"<br><br>Another Colonel rose to reply. "I believe that it is also a flawed decision to wait until the first two attacks are completed before placing defensive minefields in Logow, Bannfolk, and Deephedge. We should begin to do so as soon as practicable, rather than waiting until then, lest the Macabeans choose to invade further Ice territories." After an ominous silence for about half a minute, the General replied. "Fair enough, minefields shall then be constructed as soon as practically possible. Any further objections?" After another ominous silence, the General finished. "Then let Operation Blackseat begin."<br><br><div style="float: left;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VwHF1Z5.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div>He was then followed by the Emperor, who rose to speak as the General sat down again. "It has now been three hours since the reply I received from Fedor. Preparation for Operation Blackseat shall begin now. In one hour, the Operation shall formally commence, such that we can promptly liberate Ormont. For Klyprer, Conquest, and Riches!" And indeed, it had already been one hour since the meeting at Stonegrad had commenced.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Wingcaster, The Ice States.</span><br><br>It was already late in the evening now. That is, it was the perfect time to attack the Macabean forces. Therefore, there was little formal meeting, lest it become too late. And so Division Commander Zachary Poepping ordered after a short briefing. "We shall now be commencing our operation against the Golden Throne. Follow orders carefully. Now, you shall exit in an orderly fashion, fully equipped for immediate combat, through the emergency exits. There, you shall fire upon the Macabean forces surrounding this base. Then await further orders."<br><br>And indeed, that was what happened. The fully equipped personnel walked down the concealed staircase to underground. There was a metal door, and when all went through it was shut and locked. The Commander led the way through the concrete tunnel, until another concealed staircase was reached. The cap at the top of the staircase was opened, and the personnel stepped through. As one reached the top, they immediately ran away to fire upon the Macabeans. And the Icers were vicious. With some hiding behind trees and bunkers to hit their enemies by surprise, while others merely firing at the Macabeans one after another yet with incredible accuracy, at this point it was clear which way the battle was going. They were there not just to cease the Golden Throne's occupation of the base, but to entirely send the Macabeans surrounding the base to the underworld; or not, depending on the will of Klyprer.<br><br>In the air, a similar battle was fought by the Ice ships. The airbase sent five manually operated aircraft into the air, along with three aircraft operated entirely by Artificial Intelligence. The precision needed here, however, was too great to send any remotely-operated aircraft. Yet. And indeed, the Ice aircraft ruthlessly began firing missiles upon the Macabeans, with the goal of completely eradicating their presence at the Ice military base. Meanwhile, the Artificial Intelligence aircraft recorded precise coordinates of the Macabean aircraft, allowing for incredible precision in the Ice attacks on the Macabean fleets.<br><br>This battle was far from limited to Wingcaster. The smaller military bases and towns could not immediately deploy; especially due to the lack of any military <span style="font-style: italic">air</span>bases besides in Wingcaster and in Deephedge (outside of the currently occupied area). They needed backing from air. And so, the airbases in Wingcaster and Deephedge deployed aircraft one after another to scatter them throughout the area. The base in Wingcaster focused in sending aircraft to the Western and Southern parts of the areas to be liberated, while the base in Deephedge focused in sending arcraft to the Eastern and Northern sections. Once these aircrafts arrived at their destinations, the battle would become widespread throughout the areas to be liberated in a matter of minutes.<br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="ORBAT for current confrontation" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">-140 automated military aircraft (to detect threats, gather coordinates of opponents, create images, and deliver supplies as needed; 90 sent from Wingcaster; 70 from Deephedge)<br>-240 manually operated air-to-air combat aircraft (150 sent from Wingcaster; 90 from Deephedge)<br>-50 manually operated air-to-surface combat aircraft (35 sent from Wingcaster; 15 from Deephedge)<br>-750 air-to-air missiles (500 sent from Wingcaster; 250 from Deephedge)<br>-160 air-to-surface missiles (100 sent from Wingcaster; 60 from Deephedge)<br>-Stealth Land Force divisions 53, 61 - 65, 74, and 77 (5000 personnel; 200 units)<br>-Regular Wartime Land Force divisions 103 - 142, 189, and 200 - 242 (55000 personnel; 2200 units)<br>-240 surface-to-air missiles<br>-120000 long-distance rifles<br>-120000 short-distance rifles<br>-140 cannons</div></div></div><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Magecastle, The Ice States.</span><br><br>As the battle in Wingcaster began, a secured message was sent to the Embassy of the Golden Throne at Magecastle.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">To: Emperor Fedor<br>From: Emperor Sotolo II<br><br>To whom it may concern.<br><br>To be clear, had the intervention been, in fact, a bona fide attempt to defend the Empire's sovereignty, it would have been performed with our consent and consultation. Neither of these occured. In addition, the occupation obstructs our ability to administer our territory. For example, we have been unable to properly enforce worship of Klyprer as a result of this occupation.<br><br>We are disappointed that this was the path chosen by the Golden Throne: War, instead of peace. The fact is, that obstructing administration of our territory certainly constitutes "armed hostility" and an act of war. We also are concerned that your cable completely ignores the fact that the Golden Throne still broke its agreement that it would respect the sovereignty of the Ice States. To wit; we stay true to our word to those who can stay true to their word. This, unfortunately, is not what we can expect from the Golden Throne. Instead of accepting that its occupation of Nicaro was a mistake, and thereby preventing the escalation of this matter, as well as ensuring that the Ice States maintained its duties towards the Golden Throne, it has decided to invoke false concerns in its relentless selfishness.<br><br>As you likely already know, we are now taking action to remove the Golden Throne's occupation of Ormont, and have invoked Section 1 of Article IV in the Treaty of Liberation, terminating all duties of the Ice States to the Golden Throne under that agreement. We have also terminated the Golden Throne's embassy with the Ice States, and demand that the embassy at Magecastle be evacuated within 12 hours. It severely disappoints me, indeed, that we have had to take such drastic actions. Yet, the implications of the occupation of Ormont show nothing but disregard, at best, and contempt, at worst, for the sovereignty of the Ice States. You have thrown a strong and promising relationship between our two nations out of the window in a matter of hours. We expect our allies to be just slightly more loyal than your nation has been to ours.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Jeramy Vliet,<br>Duke of Magecastle,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.<br><br>~Sotolo II,<br>Emperor,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.<br><br>~Klyprer,<br>Lord of the Cosmos,<br>With behalf of the Chief Scribe,<br>The Empire of The Ice States.</span></blockquote><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Logow, The Ice States</span><br><br>Three divisions of the Ice Land Force were deployed to Logow, where their task was to construct a large minefield surrounding the North and East of Logow. Given how large the area was, small vehicles disguised as a civilian car to satellites above were used to lay the mines in the area; they would work by creating a small hole in the ground, placing the mine therein, and then adding a layer of earth around one centimetre thick. The process was lengthy and tiresome, but necessary; and by over two hours, while war raged over in the Green Zone, the minefield was complete.<br><br>Logow could now only be approached from the Southwest, which would be easily and well defended by the nearby Ice forces. Indeed, these forces remained on full alert for attacks on the city; using automated, small aircraft to detect any attempt to attack Logow, or the airplanes, or the military base. Personnel also set themselves up outside of the city to watch out for attacks. Around that time, the process of securing Bannfolk and Deephedge with the planned minefields was completed; and the military forces in both cities, likewise, remained in highest alert for attacks on their respective cities.</div>

<div class="content">The CFA's message was received and the answer was given quickly. The Marshite military had been prepping for action in the Ice States longer than was necessary for an operation of the scope and size, and the fact that the Ice States was so close to the Theocratic Matriarchy only made the military response quicker. The named First Ice States Crusade was announced as the first attacks were launched.<br>The Golden Throne was sent a message indicating that the Marshite military was going to conduct a large-scale military operation throughout the nation, with ground actions likely to follow in the momentary occupation of the Ice States. The Marshites had no intention of interfering with Throne ambitions, and sought any further discussion on the matter so as to avoid any unfortunate overlapse. They also would inform the Throne that Marshite aircraft would be available to aid them, if called upon.<br>To the PUF the Marshites detailed the general military response as well as informed them that they agreed to an earlier proposal that would see the 438th Crusade that was currently in Motokata placed under the command of the PUF commander of military opersations in the theater. It was expected that the PUF would soon launch their own invasion and when they did so, they would do so with the three-hundred thousand soldiers of the 438th under their command.<br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Operations" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">Operations are divided into the following:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Green</span> is the term for all naval operations in the waters and seas bordering the east of the Ice States. Group Eastfold is tasked with the destruction of all Icer military vessels and the dominance of the waters surrounding the hostile nation.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Green Sun</span> is the name of their ground support, air support, and blockade operation for the rest of the planned conflict.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Tone</span> is the term for all naval operations in the Sea of Faith. Group Ixana is tasked with the destruction of all Icer naval assets in the Sea of Faith and the dominance of the Sea of Faith.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Tone Setter</span> is the name of their ground support, air support, and blockade operation for the rest of the planned conflict.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Cured Green</span> is the umbrella term for all ground operations in the east of the Ice States. Amphibious deployments are planned along the Stonegrad axis and the Magecastle axis after the attached naval forces have secured absolute naval dominance. Both of these amphibious operations take place after the operations in Stale Tone have been launched, under the belief that the Icer military would by necessity have to respond. Amphibious deployments on the Stonegrad Axis are also tasked with taking Redwell, while the Maagecastle group will also move to take Bannfolk and Sopia. Cured Green will get air support from TMAF and TMN forces.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><br>Operation: Stale Tone</span> is the umbrella term for all ground operations in the west-center of the Ice States. After naval dominance has been secured, ground operations will begin. Amphibious Deployments will target the region south of Wintercourt, which will form into groups that would swing left to take Foxtead before continuing north, while the second will crash into the city of Wintercourt itself. Another deploymenmt will be near the border of Southport and Old Witch. This would also split into two, with the main thrust moving towards Magecastle while the second will move to secure Redwell. The third amphibious deployment would be near the Valenpool river, where the eastern deployment will be small but there to aid the CFA while the western half will be tasked with clearing that side of the river- up through and beyond Valenpool itself. Stale Tone will get air support from TMAF and TMN forces.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Cleansing Scent </span>is the term for the pre-invasion aerial campaign to be conducted by TMAF. They will seek to destroy the Icer Air Force and their military installations as well as air defenses through massive bombing waves and pinpoint attacks alike. They will seek to dominate the skies over the entirety of the nation by not only destroying their opponents on the ground but by engaging and destroying targets in the air. They will also target and destroy command and control facilities, enemy troop concentrations, and any and all targets of military value- regardless of how minor, once the target rich environment becomes poorer. Cleansing Scent's goal is to cause as much deep and irreverisble damage to the Icer military and regime as possible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Burrownest</span> is the term for the post-invasion aerial campaign to be conducted by TMAF. This will include direct air support to all Marshite forces across the whole warzone, as well as the support of any and all PUF advances in the west, Golden Throne advances in the north if requested, and the CFA in the east. Burrownest will continue until the war is over.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Operation: Intza </span>is the umbrella term for a number of special operations conducted by M-SAD. WHITE Intza is the M-SAD intelligence operation aimed at directly supporting the CFA and allied forces, with intelligence and communications aid. BLACK Intza is an electronic warfare program aimed at shattering the internal communications of the Icer military and the government at all levels. GREY Intza is the self-defense electronic warfare operation aimed at securing Marshite systems and communications. All three M-SAD Operations were coordinated at the highest levels by not only experienced operatives, but a legion of AI Citizen Clusters. RED Intza is the direct assassination or capture operation undertaken by MSAD DAT (Direct Action Teams), supported by the USFC (Union Special Forces Command) and its myriad units, targeted at the Icer military and government. BLUE Intza is the name of a propaganda operation aimed at the people and Icer military, with the direct aim of getting as many to surrender or switch sides as possible. YELLOW Intza does not exist.<br><br>It is known that the Holy Warriors are involved. Their location and involvement remains<span style="font-weight: bold"> unknown</span>.</div></div></div><br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2

and Operation: Tone began in earnest at sea. The first targets would be any and all Icer naval vessels in the wide area of operations. Thousands of Marshite vessels took part in either operation and brought with them withering firepower. Lacto-Class CGNs and Lamia-class DDGNs on an individual basis tended to be equipped for defensive or offensive roles, though writ large the Lacto-class were offensive in nature and the Lamia-class defensive. The Anubis-class Heavy Arsenal Ships were more dual role, with the smaller VLS systems preppd with defensive and the larger VLS systems were prepped with offensive armament, while the Pijl-classes tended to be more defensive. of course, it was armed so well that even a defensively oriented Pijl could send devastating volleys of missiles towards its opponents. The Longsword-class Guided Missile Warship was outfitted for a number of roles- though the first few seen were more offensively oriented. In the skies, the Luna-class Carrier and the Kazatlan-class-class Escort Carriers would unleash dozens of squadrons of aircraft at a time. Pegasus and Silent Pegasus aircraft made up the majority of initial squadrons, with their primary gol being the dominance of the skies over the oceans and then the consistent sweeping of the enemy's naval forces, followed by the MAF-52 Griffon. They were supported electronically by the E-20A Pontus and other electronic support in the area, piggybacking off of the overall SACHERI Battlespace. Hundreds of helicopters took part as well with changing missions. Most were outfitted for electronic warfare and ASW operations to start, though over time they could evolve into search and rescue and even boarding operations. Under the water, LA-603 Dadao class SSBN/SSGNs would target important targets and otherwise move aggressively into enemy territory. LA-602 Kukri class AIP/SSKs hunted down opposing submarines to defend the fleet as well as as the flanks of it from underwater threats. LA-601 Xiphos class SSNs worked in packs to push like a dagger into the heart of the enemy, never giving them a moment to rest. FAC-36 and Libertas frigates carried lighter offensive armament, with the Libertas in particular mostly used as an ASW vessel.<br><br>Both operations moved aggressively. Waves of LA-1330 Contrados, Muraena AShMs, LY4045s, and HK-7 Viking anti-ship missiles would be launched, followed in turn by less concentrated and timed attacks, then by concentrated waves. This was intentional. The varying speed, heights, methods, and timing of attacks was meant to permanently place the Icer naval forces on the backfoot, constantly having to move and use up their defensive munitions even as they took increasingly heavy losses as the battle continued. If they did not, then any single wave- these were some of the deadliest and most advanced anti-ship missiles in the world and fired in consistently great volumes- would be liable to crack the Icer navy in one fell swoop in any given zone. Still though, it was an attritional struggle in any case with time ticking, and it did not even consider the other offensive weapons being used. Marshite aircraft would seek, strike, and destroy any theat to their air dominance in the seas or along the coasts within range of the Marshite naval aircraft or vessels. Then they would mercilessly and relentlessly attack Icer naval vessels, more than happy to attack concentrations of naval vessels as happily as smother single vessels. Under the ocean, Marshite submarines would move aggressively against Icer vessels, forcing the enemy to contend with merciless attacks from all three vectors.<br><br>Defensively, the plan was to so aggressively engage the enemy that his attacks would come in fits and starts and lack the necessary volume. Still, the Ice States had shown itself to fight well at sea and as such the Theocracy made sure that its vessels took a more defensive loadout than usual. Many vessels were outfitted purely defensively, and most had some devotion to the defensive factor. Anti-air missiles such as the LY4030, LY4031, and Sea Krait PD-SAM were used in vast abundance, along with arrays of electronic systems and various cannons and CIWS systems. The oppressive presence of various ASW vessels and helicopters, not to mention the hungry and aggressive Kukris, further pressed the defensive envelope against opposing submarines.<br><br>While both oceans would experience vast engagements, there were areas focused on to a greater and lesser extent. In the Sea of Faith, everything to the west of the Southport Split was to be cleansed first, with only a smaller naval movement meant to engage inside of that Split. Only once naval vessels belonging to the Ice States were destroyed or captured outside of the area would forces attached to Operation: Tone clear Southport Bay as thoroughly. Operation: Green started on the extreme edges of the Ice States and worked their way to the middle, though due to the vast size of the movements involved most of the zone would see some combat regardless at all times until ana rea was thoroughly swept.<br><br>As areas were cleared of enemy vessels, expected enemy minefields would be discovered and marked. Lente-class MCMV's would move under protection to clear them. Once the minework began and the sea zones were declared safe, Marshite naval forces would then start to destroy military targets within range of the fleet where needed as they prepared for an amphibious invasion.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>While Operation: Green and Operation: Tone commenced, Operation: Cleansing Scent would begin. Indeed, it was the first of the operations to kick off, with the TMAF more than ready to start their bloody work. The first waves would focus on the Icer ability to resist future air attacks, with bomber waves targeting any and all known Icer air bases while covered and escorted by fighters. Meanwhile, active AA and radar that sought to disrupt this would be targeted by crushing and precise air attacks by large numbers of stealth attackers and more conventional, if still aggressive, attack aircraft. If the Icer air force did not sally forth to defend their airspace they would be destroyed, but by sallying forth they risked tremendous air losses nonetheless. Still, after the first wave would come a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth. The strikes would move deeper and with just as much force. The waves would be relentless- one after another, the target list expanding with each new incoming attack as Icer air assets would be degraded severely given time. These new targets would be other army bases, command and control facilities, communication hardpoints, enemy concentrations and any and all defensive zones prepared or in preparation. Roads and highways would be targeted en masse and consistently as well, as would bridges and railways. Only targets left off of specific lists generated by M-SAD and by request from the CFA or other Marshite allies were to be spared; everything else could be rebuilt.<br><br>When it was decided that the Icer air force could no longer engage with the Marshites in the sky or impede TMAF, it would instead focus on keeping air wings in the sky above the nation at all times rather than working in waves. This would be to catch forces that had tried to hide previously and sought to avoid being caught in the attacks. From time to time TMAF would send whole air divisions in country to handle certain missions, but otherwise it was somewhat more 'relaxed' as TMAF continued to hammer the military capability of the Ice States.</div>

It was positioned some 20 kilometers north of Wingcaster and considered vital for controlling the highway to the city. The soldiers inside had not abandoned their position. Atmos had been ordered to surround the base with his mechanized brigade and control movements into it and out. In practice, that meant monitoring what the Icean soldiers inside did and restricting access to the base. The former he accomplished via positioning a number of fire teams within visual range, using their own tactical drones to enhance their intelligence gathering. At the brigade level, two larger stealth reconnaissance drones kept an eye on the base and the surrounding area, feeding their sensor data into the brigade's military network. For the latter, the restriction of access to the base, Atmos deployed his unit throughout the area and occupied heights along the road, along with other heights in mutual support. They were all sent into nearby towns and villages, commandeering local police stations and other 'hard points' from which they could coordinate the dispersion of their men. It would be hard for the Iceans to reach this base without being fired on and having their flanks exposed.<br><br>For all the effort Atmos had put into surveilling the base and its soldiers, he didn't quite catch them leaving the complex through a series of underground tunnels. He didn't quite predict that they had underground tunnels, either. Although the drones were reporting movement within the base, there was little evidence of large-scale maneuvers and so when the Icean soldiers emerged from these tunnels to attack the small teams of Macab&#233;an observers posted around the base complex it took Atmos, the brigade, and his men by surprise.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...in the air.</span></span><br><br>It was a stealth surveillance drone that caught the large Icean bombers leaving their hangars, accelerating down the long runways, and lifting into the air. At first, aside from the number of bombers launched, there was nothing particularly startling about the intelligence. They could be bombing hapless civilians in Valenpool. But as they were tracked by early warning and CAP assets, as well as ground-based radars, it was increasingly evident that their vector was northward. They came from two angles, one originating in the Wingcaster area and the other from Deephedge. Because of the relative proximity of the airbases they had come from, it didn't take them long to get within range. The Icean bombers unleashed a torrent of missiles before the Macab&#233;an military could put together a coherent reaction.<br><br>As these missiles streaked across the sky, slicing through clouds as they descended upon their targets, ground-based surface-to-air batteries opened up in defense. Long columns of dark smoke trailed their missiles as they lifted toward the heavens and raced in the direction of their Icean counterparts. In decentralized coordination, fighter aircraft partaking in the combat air patrols that were within range engaged the incoming projectiles with short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles. Where inbound and outbound missiles connected, explosions resulted. But the Iceans had the element of surprise in hand and the Macab&#233;an defense was inadequate, allowing the vast majority of Icean missiles to strike their targets below. Domes of fire erupted where they hit.<br><br>War, though, was a series of battles and although the Iceans had gotten away with a first strike it didn't mean they'd get away with another one.<br><br>While the Icean bombers were making their way northward, the Laerihans scrambled its interceptors. From north of the frontier with Nicaro, four squadrons of AEJ-36 Seraphs were raised with the explicit objective of catching up with those bombers and engaging them from beyond visual range. They were joined by another six squadrons of Lu-45s that would provide a loose sort of escort and, more specifically, engage Icean fighters and drones. An Arcaenian design, the prestigious Seraph was the pinnacle of stealth fighter technology. The Lu-45 was a stealth fighter too but had been the workhorse of the Laerihans for over twelve years now. The latter were relatively expendable and could be risked in a 'dogfight.' Their counterparts, the Seraph, were more valuable, even stealthier &#8212; especially as they only carried weapons in their internal bays for this particular strike &#8212;, and better used for the types of missions they were committed to now. Flying low to the ground, the ten squadrons of fighter aircraft fanned out as they rapidly flew southward into battle. Screaming above the treeline, they crossed the frontier from Nicaro into the Ice States and rapidly closed with their enemies.<br><br>In the meantime, the Lu-45s and naval GLI-76s that had formed the squadrons committed to the layers of combat air patrol directly over the Macab&#233;an front line were in a struggle of their own. Along with the heavy bombers, the Iceans had launched drones and fighter jets to engage the Golden Throne's airforce. The skies were a festival of chaff, flares, smoke, and fire. Intermittent jamming blocked radars and then awoke them again. The CAP could count on drones of their own to conduct much of this jamming, as well as to present themselves as targets by mimicking the signature of a full-sized Lu-45 or by emitting a radar signal. In the midst of this confusing anarchy of aerial warfare, fighters launched air-to-air missiles to intercept those sent against them and against enemy aircraft alike. All the same, caught somewhat by surprise, the fighters and drones which formed the CAP took a good beating. Aircraft missing wings or engines or even entire halves plummeted to the ground, their pilots ejecting from out the cockpits if they were lucky enough to be able to do so. These quietly parachuted their way down toward the ground, hoping to be picked up by friendlies although many were on their way to becoming prisoners of war.<br><br>As this initial screening force felt the brunt of the Icean strike, the newly scrambled squadrons of Lu-45s broke through the clouds to strike. The enemy had fired their missiles and would need to return to base to rearm. The six squadrons of Lu-45s hit them just as they were turning or on their return flight, using their beyond-visual-range missiles to engage and force their foes to enter evasive maneuvers. As their BVR munitions closed range, so did they. Besides their BVR missiles, each of them carried two short/medium-range missiles &#8212; one on each wingtip. With these, they hoped to deliver a final blow to punish the Icean first strike.<br><br>All the while, the four squadrons of Seraphs maintained their approach toward the enemy bombers. They increased their elevation as they made their terminal run, their sleek curves of stealth slicing through the air like battle scythes. To increase their stealthiness, they carried no weapons on their wingtip hardpoints, just four BVR air-to-air missiles in the internal weapons bay. They unleashed their stores at the large, lumbering bombers at a distance of 90 kilometers. With a maximum range of around 160 kilometers, the BVR missiles would cover the 90-kilometer distance within about 64 seconds during which the bombers &#8212; if at their maximum estimated speed &#8212; would travel another 17&#8211;20 kilometers, still well within the range of the air-to-air missiles screaming toward them. The impact would occur in under 80 seconds from the initial launch time. But the science was of no concern to the Seraphs, which quickly turned around and headed back to their airbases in southern Nicaro.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...on the ground: just behind the frontlines.</span></span><br><br>As the initial air battle unfolded, one of the MLRS batteries organized at the corps level belonging to CXL Mechanized Corps was instructed to move forward toward the frontline under the escort of F Company, 2870th Infantry Battalion, 1813th Armored Brigade, 970th Mechanized Infantry Division. Nine launchers total. They didn't have to travel far, Wingcaster was well within the range of their guided rockets. Setting up shop within an open space, their escorting company positioned itself around the perimeter in defense, and with a few tactical drones scouring the area for signs of the enemy, the battery was ready to fire within minutes. Their target? The Wingcaster-area airbase from which the Icean bombers had taken off. After all, the best way of denying the enemy the opportunity to bomb Macab&#233;an forces in northern TIS was to deny the enemy of their airfields.<br><br>In less than 60 seconds, the battery of nine MLRS emptied their launchers. Trailed by a thick pillar of smoke, 108 rockets shrieked toward the Wingcaster airbase. The battery did not waste time packing up and withdrawing back north, along with its escorting company.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...on the ground: Koronel Atmos Gutes.</span></span><br><br>While the other battles played out, Atmos' focus was on the ground battle unfolding before him.<br><br>Under heavy fire, his scouting parties nearest to the base had taken heavy casualties. He ordered them to withdraw a short distance and disengage with the enemy. This would force the Iceans to either stay put or chase them. If they did the latter, Atmos' brigade was well positioned to engage the vulnerable Icean force from its flanks. While the Iceans had achieved some surprise through their use of tunnels, it also meant that all of their heavy equipment &#8212; like armored vehicles &#8212; were back in the base. Atmos ordered his armored battalion to move forward and engage.<br><br>As he waited for his armored support, Atmos surveyed the firefight through the various monitors before him. It made his heavy armored personnel carrier seem small, even though it wasn't carrying its full complement to make space for the koronel's mobile command post. But he put whatever feelings of claustrophobia behind him and focused. A mortar infantry platoon had already moved into a position about two kilometers away from the fighting and had started to drop high explosive bombs on the aggrupations of enemies. Another platoon was moving into a different position to support an additional mechanized infantry company about to enter the fight. Atmos' main goal was to pin the enemy down and keep them on their toes while the heavy firepower was on the way.<br><br>His vehicle suddenly shook with violence and the hull reverberated with the sound of various explosions, some close by and others farther away. The Iceans had launched a missile strike and it seemed that most of these had gotten through Macab&#233;an air defenses. The radio became alive with casualty reports and check-ins, but he tuned them out except those relevant to his brigade and the ongoing battle. The strike would take its toll, but Macab&#233;an units were on the move, shifting, and well-dispersed, and after quickly mulling over the incoming updates it seemed that the attack had lacked a more precise plan. It would have to dawn on the Iceans that they had chosen to go to war with a veteran mechanized military force coming out of successful conflicts in Gholgoth, Krasnova, and Killia. They would learn soon enough. As for how it affected his brigade, the koronel took mental note of casualties, although the battlefield management system also updated the screen with color gradations to denote shifting unit strengths, and then turned his attention to leveraging his resources to neutralize the enemy.<br><br>One of those resources was a divisional 160mm self-propelled artillery battalion that was moving around farther north, between 15&#8211;25 kilometers away. Requesting time-on-target fire support, the battalion lent him a seven-vehicle battery that began to blanket the Icean lines with high-explosive shells. Although Atmos couldn't see them, he knew that the howitzers were 'shooting and scooting' &#8212; they'd fire off a number of rounds each, each shell with a different computer-resolved trajectory in order to land <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> shells on the enemy at the same time, then the vehicles would change location and fire again. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. The heavy artillery fire thundered even against the already deafening sounds of the battlefield.<br><br>Battles like these were playing out from one side of northern TIS to the other. While some brigades were held back to pin down and isolate the Iceans breaking out of their military bases, the rest were still moving southward. CXL Corps was assigned the eastern sector, ending just west of Wingcaster, while XVC Corps was assigned the western sector, with a primary objective including the encirclement and occupation of Deephedge. Their forces were now fanning out and advancing more cautiously, now that the Icean military was resisting.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...on the ground: cutting pockets of resistance off.</span></span><br><br>An army and its units were combat-effective so long as they had ammunition, medicine, food, and other supplies. Cut them off from their lifeline and that army or its units were as good as dead.<br><br>While commanders like Koronel Atmos Gutes surrounded, engaged, and pinned down Icean military forces to the rear of the frontline, others were busying themselves setting up roadblocks and occupying heights along major highways and roads in order to control the movement of forces. Enemy forces trying to reinforce, relieve, or resupply TIS forces sallying from their bases would find themselves under attack well before they got close &#8212; and <span style="font-style: italic">if</span> they got close, as unlikely as that was given the number of Macab&#233;an military forces pouring into the country, then they'd have the tactical blockades set up by the besieging brigades themselves. There was confidence that if the sallying Icean forces weren't killed or pummeled into surrendering, then they'd run out of supplies soon rather than later anyway. And the more intense the combat, the sooner that time would come. One way or another, they'd be neutralized.<br><br>Corps artillery was busying itself with targets <span style="font-style: italic">across</span> the frontlines in the meantime. Their fire was guided by forward observation teams as well as observation drones flying ahead of the mechanized columns continuing their southward advance. Heavy howitzers and MLRS targeted frontline Icean military forces, their emplacements, enemy artillery and rocket fire, but also directed fire at logistical convoys ferrying supplies between depots and frontline forces.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">OOC NOTES</span></span><br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Ground Forces ORBAT" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">CXL Mechanized Corps (ca. 85,000 troops) [Eastern Sector]<br>- 737th Mechanized Infantry Division (ca. 15,000)<br>- 970th Mechanized Infantry Division<br>- 113rd Mechanized Infantry Division<br>- 197th Armored Division (ca. 10,000)<br>- 19th Corps Artillery (ca. 4,000)<br>- 2360th Cavalry Brigade (ca. 5,000)<br>- 1819th Cavalry Brigade<br>- 893rd Engineering Brigade (ca. 3,000)<br>- 117th Military Intelligence Brigade<br>- 239th Military Police Brigade<br>- 730th Signals Brigade<br>- 819th Sustainment Brigade<br>- 33rd Medical Brigade<br>- 314th Koro-Kirim Battalion (ca. 600)<br><br>XVC Mechanized Corps (ca. 85,000 troops) [Western Sector]<br>- 588th Mechanized Infantry Division<br>- 673rd Mechanized Infantry Division<br>- 287th Mechanized Infantry Division<br>- 122nd Armored Division<br>- 76th Corps Artillery<br>- 1870th Cavalry Brigade<br>- 1350th Cavalry Brigade<br>- 298th Engineering Brigade<br>- 1038th Military Intelligence Brigade<br>- 342nd Military Police Brigade<br>- 663rd Signals Brigade<br>- 254th Sustainment Brigade<br>- 47th Medical Brigade<br>- 11th Koro-Kirim Battalion</div></div></div></div></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">House of the Senate <br>Mokastana City, Mokastana </span><br><br>The emergency closed door meeting of the Federal Senate was held shortly after the Icer attack against the Macabean forces. As rockets exploded and gunfire erupted on the other side of the region, the Senate debated. They had already received information from the Marshites about their planned attacks, and witnessed their opening moves. Now the Ice States was effectively at war with two major powers, and a growing communist insurgency had asked the PUF to intervene militarily. The situation across the border of Motokata was growing more intense every minute. All along the Motokatan border, the Federal army was poised to strike, previously due to the evacuation of the embassy, but now in case of war. <br><br>With the Ice States being torn apart by the war, with one of the attackers being a major ally, the Federation had to make a choice: intervene or remain neutral. War would require a two thirds vote from the 315 Senators, or 210 votes. The argument in favor of war pointed to the hostility of the current Ice State regime, the loyalty of the marshites to aid the PUF when it fought wars, and the importance of having influence in the future of the Ice States for peace along the border. The opposition argued that the Ice States was doomed regardless, and it wasn't worth sending Federal lives, the PUF was already sending weapons and vehicles to the communists, and its allies would make short work of the Ice State regime with or without PUF help. <br><br>After a few backroom negotiations, emotional speeches, and a few taunts, the votes were cast. The majority of Motokatan senators, regardless of party, had voted in favor of war, being led by the Motokatan Nationalist Party who basically said Motokata was willing to go to war with or without Federal support, the Marshite Defense Council Party also voted mostly in favor of war. It was of no surprise both the Lyran style parties voted in favor of the war, as did the Socialists, but the three major political parties were more divided. The People's Party was largely in favor with some dissent, the Liberal Party was more split down the middle, and the Conservative Party was mostly against, supported largely by the collection of small government parties elected to the Senate. <br><br>In the end the vote passed with 218 votes, when they needed 210. The Federal Army, backed by Marshite Support, would be joining in the war&#8230;.<br><br><hr><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokata/Ice States Border<br>Within hours of the vote</span><br><br>All along the Border, various Icean border checkpoints, radar stations, artillery sites, bases and runways have been targeted based on months, if not years, of intelligence gathering. Satellite imagery helped determine paths of attack that could pierce deep into Ice State's territory. The goal of the border attack would be to threaten, if not take, Hoggard and Foxstead. <br><br>The plan of attack was as follows: YA-42 Corsaires and LY910 Shadowhawks would contest the skies near the border, backed by Skyguard batteries on the Motokatan side of the border. As they fought the Ice States Air Force, YA-28 Eclipses would fly low and fast to hit enemy air defenses in wild weasel missions.<br><br>As for the ground mission. Northern and Southern Military districts would attack targets along the border, taking what territory across the border they needed to fortify the border and secure Motokatan. They would then remain in reserve with the bulk of the conscript forces to defend Motokata from any counter attacks into the nation. As they distracted the Ice States by attacking targets up and down the border, a spearhead made by the 98th Armored Division, flanked by two Naval Infantry Divisions, would break through the border and push towards Foxstead. LY9 Dire Wolf Tanks would hit the strong points backed by 155mm Self propelled artillery and Haize designed MLRS batteries, while the bulk of the Armored division's LY4A2 Wolfhound Tanks pushed around enemy defenses and flanked them from behind. The 98th Armored Division would be leading the way for the lead elements of the Federal 21st Army: 1st and 2nd Corps led by Generalissimo Minor Nakata himself. <br><br>To the south along the coast, the Marshite 438th Crusade, under Federal Command, would push deep into Ice States aiming to take Hoggard, and then head north towards Wintercourt. They would be supported by the 44th Federal Assault Fleet and 2nd Motokatan Carrier Fleet heading up the coast. Eventually, two Naval Infantry Divisions, carried by the 20th and 8th Marine Transport Flotillas would begin amphibious operations east of Haggard to distract the defenders and force them to redirect forces to the coast. Ideally, the sheer weight of the Allied Naval forces in the area would make anything approaching the landings a target in a cruise missile shooting gallery. <br><br><br><br>ORBAT:<br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Show Spoiler" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';      this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide Spoiler'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show Spoiler'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;"><span style="font-weight: bold">PUSH TOWARDS OAKMOUTH:</span><br>21st Army, 2nd Corps: 200,000 personnel<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">PUSH TOWARDS FOXSTEAD:</span><br>98th Armored Division: 20,000 personnel<br>12th Naval Infantry Division: 22,000 personnel <br>21st Army, 1st Corps: 200,000 personnel<br><ul><li> K010 Motor Rifle Division 21,500 personnel</li></ul><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">PUSH TOWARDS HOGGARD:</span><br>438th Crusade: 300,000 personnel <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">TOTAL FORCES IN MOTOKATA</span><br>21st Army: Motokata District - Generalissimo Minor Nakata <br>800,000 Professional Soldiers<br>22nd Army: Southern Military District - Generalissimo Tsutsui<br>600,000 Professional, 400,000 Conscripts<br>23rd Army: Northern Military District - Generalissimo Dandon<br>600,000 Professional, 400,000 Conscripts<br><br>Federal Reinforcements:<br>15th Army: 2nd Corps<br>100,000 Professionals, 100,000 Conscripts (Wellovia)<br>17th Army: 4th Corps<br>100,000 Professionals, 100,000 Conscripts (Aqua Anu)<br>8th Army: 5th Corps: 98th Armored Division (Fort Mokan, Greal)<br>20,000 Professionals<br>Federal Navy:<br>6x Naval Infantry Divisions (Motokata)<br>133,700 Professionals<br><br>Marshite Reinforcements:<br>438th Crusade with appropriate air cover,<br>300,000 Professionals</div></div></div></div>

<div class="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3028oDEKZo4" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">21st Century Schizoid Man.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Wingcaster, the Ice States.</span><br><br>As the stream of missiles poured into the Ice military airbase in Wingcaster, the base was effectively doomed. While many missiles were, of course, shot down before any damage could occur, the sheer scale meant that even 2% or 3% hitting the base would almost completely destroy the airbase. And that was what happened -- the entire airbase was engulfed in flames. The Ice fleets could only use whatever supplies they already had in the air. The same fate also destroyed the airbase in Wintercourt, which was completely destroyed by the attack. Yet, despite causing heavy losses upon the Ice military, there was one benefit it provided: the Macabean attack was severely weakened by the loss of a substantial portion of their weaponry in destroying the airbases.<br><br>The returned fire, of course, also resulted in the destruction of dozens of Ice air-to-air combat aircraft. Many unconsciously dodged the attacking missiles, that was only for those which were poorly aimed; the majority of targetted aircraft had to engage in complex maneuvers to avoid the fire which was being sent by the Macabean invaders. Those that were too unlucky -- or perhaps inept -- to avoid this fire ended up falling straight to the ground, many while still actively burning at the hands of the fire from the deployed Macabean missiles. Notably, Ice fleets were ordered not to attempt to shoot down the deployed Macabean missiles, as to avoid depleting the now-limited resources; simple dodging was advised instead. While some Ice aircraft disobeyed this order, largely prior to its full delivery, this served to minimise the cost on Ice weaponry of this battle. Yet, it was already having its severe cost on Ice ships -- not to mention the military bases in the area.<br><br>Yet, even with the destruction of so many of the deployed Ice aircraft, once the Macabean attack was in control, a stream of missiles was then placed in response upon the Macabean vessels; or, at least, the ones within sufficient range to be targetted. 150 were carefully aimed to directly hit the Macabean aircraft, and simoultaneously deployed. The goal was to bring great ruin on the Macabeans as soon as practicable, as to reduce their ability to defend themselves. Most of the Ice aircraft -- ie those which had followed orders -- still each had one missile which could be used against the Macabeans should it be required in due time. However, it was only one; due victory in the immediate combat was needed.<br><br>On land, it was a similar fight. The Macabeans had a clear logistical advantage; not only were the Icers outnumbered, but the Macabean forces had stronger and greater equipment than the Icers. The Macabeans were heavily armed with artillery, which the Icers did not have. Yet, the Icers had an advantage in that the Macabeans were apparently not engaging with the Ice air-to-surface warfare deployments. Yet, the air-to-air aircraft were certainly engaging indiscriminately with the Macabean military aircraft, including both air-to-surface and air-to-air deployments. <br><br>The Icers would not fall for the trap conveniently laid by the Golden Throne. Instead of directly engaging by land, the Ice Land forces were ordered to remain in their current positions, preventing any advances forward. Meanwhile, the air-to-surface deployments would fire upon the Macabean deployments from the skies. The 50 air-to-surface aircraft in total dropped 80 missiles upon the Macabeans, carefully aiming at and directly targetting the more remote locations where Macabeans had elected to remain. In addition, the deployed Stealth Land divisions, most of which had not yet been discovered, directly fired upon the Macabeans in their supposed hiding places in areas which could not be fired upon by the air forces. The Macabean forces were, in practice, trapped between the Stealth divisions which would target any further deployments, and the rest of the Land forces, which would halt any advancement Southward by the Macabeans. The Ice forces on land had, by now, lost about a tenth of their personnel. Yet, they had come for victory, and they would get victory.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Wintercourt, The Ice States.</span><br><br>Some final, last-minute editions were made to the code for BLACKSEAT.exe. First and foremost, BLACKSEAT now shut down infected computers each time five networks are infected, instead of every 12 hours. This was done to prevent Macabeans from having twelve hours to detect the existence of the file. Secondly, the code was obfuscated as to make it more difficult to discover the file's malicious nature. Thirdly, a kill switch was established as to allow for the bug's shutting down should the Golden Throne decide to surrender or otherwise cease its occupation; this allowed for the attack to remain not only a means for weakening the Macabean military capability, but also a means of coercion. This kill switch worked upon the receipt by infected devices across ten specific networks of an encrypted code; specifically, a set of prime factors which would be multiplied to form a 3000-bit integer which would be hardcoded into BLACKSEAT.exe. These prime factors would be securely sent to ten networks, which would be targetted for such a kill switch; and the code would be unique for each network. The factorisation of these integers would therefore be an exercise in futility, making it effectively impossible to falsely trigger this kill switch.<br><br>And so it began. Email after email was sent to known Macabean military addresses of new enlistees, which were personalised to avoid premature detection of their origin or links. Now, all it took would be for one of them to click open the link which was emailed to them, ostensibly being disguised as various legitimate email sources intended to attrack clicks: fake news (ironically much of which expressed anti-Ice sentiment); email verification; and so on. When these links were clicked, they would download and automatically run the malicious BLACKSEAT.exe file on the military devices. The attack had begun, and the war had spread not just to the physical frontlines; but to the realm of digits.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Somewhere in the coast of Southport.</span><br><br>As the Marshite fleets began their incursion into the Ice seas, the first defenses were from air. Indeed, the marine border was, at this point, heavily militarised to prevent any Marshite incursion; especially given intelligence services having received news of the CFA seeking military aid from both Holy Marsh and the People's United Federation. The Icers were not knowledgeable of what the Marshite response; yet, preparations would still need to be taken in case the Marshites did opt to invade.<br><br>Accordingly, the air-to-surface aircraft in the area, as well as the Ice ships and submarines, each deployed full weaponry on Marshite targets. A deadly wave of thuosands of missiles and cannonballs was sent the way of the Marshite ships operating in the Sea of Faith; along with thousands of additional air missiles deployed both from land (in the form of surface-to-air missiles) and from the air upon Marshite aircraft. As with the battle in Ormont, Ice aircraft were ordered to manually dodge any counter-strike, and avoid striking back to shoot down Marshite attacks; the Marshites, despite holding a similar amount of vessels to the Icers, had many more weapons that could be used against the Ice fleets. Likewise, in the Eastern attack on Ice waters, Marshite forces were attacked on sight as they approached Ice waters; and aircraft were also targetted by manually operated air-to-air aircraft and surface-to-air weaponry.<br><br>Meanwhile, the attacks on airbases throughout the Ice States posed a lesser, albeit still significant, challenge to the Ice air forces. The automated defense systems in the airbases and military bases in Emerstead, Sandford, and Wintercourt managed to repel air attacks thereto sufficiently as to prevent any long-term damage; yet, if the Marshites continued in their attacks, the damage <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be permanent. Therefore, the response was a widespread, attack of Marshite aircraft, exclusively using remote aircraft launching long-distance air-to-air missiles. Literal thousands of missiles streaked the air as they went after the Marshite aircraft; with the goal of preventing any further attacks of land targets by Marshite aircraft.<br><br>A few hours later, after news reached Stonegrad of the confrontation and a decision could be made, the General Lionel Burkes himself ordered Operation Sinboro Pony. This was an operation to conquer the Marshite territory directly south of the Ice States; partly to weaken the Marshite military capability, and to increase the difficulty of the transportation of further resources to support the ongoing invasion. And so, fleets of Ice air-to-surface combat aircraft travelled through the occupied area towards the Sinboro Strait; before promptly simoultaneously firing thousands of long-distance chemical and incendiary missiles towards civilian and military targets in the North of the island; specifically population centres, military bases, and naval ports. These aircraft were promptly followed by air-to-air combat aircraft, along with further air-to-surface combat aircraft which were directed to enter marshite airspace as to occupy the airspace of the Northern parts of the islands. This was intended to pave the way for an eventual ground and naval invasion of the island.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Motokatan border of the Ice States.</span><br><br>The Motokatan invasion was vicious, at best. Their scale -- over 100 thousand troops -- was, frankly, unbeatable. In the immediate deployment, no attack by even the heavily militarised border could repel the invasion; the only way by which the invasion could be stopped was the deployment of additional forces in the area; and deploying them to the area in time would be highly unrealistic. The Ice forces would have to live with what limited resources they had there.<br><br>As the Mokan troops approached, they were immediately asked about their intentions; and as with the Marshites, the Icers were already suspicious as their intelligence had revealed that the CFA had requested assistance from the Mokans; and, just a few hours ago, the Mokan assembly had already voted to declare war on the Empire. The Icers got a response, but not in the form that they expected, with artillery fire opening from the border and airstrikes beginning from the skies.<br><br>The Ice response was, therefore, prompt. Incendiary bombing of Mokan targets across the border began from the air; while the Mokan border patrol was, likewise, fired upon from land with artillery, as well as regular rifles and weapons. Meanwhile, in Ice military bases surface-to-air missiles were fired upon the air bombers and inbound air strikes; while military fighter aircraft worked on destroying the Mokan aircraft. Yet, the damage on Ice forces was already severe; and already one fifth of the Ice aircraft was entirely destroyed by the attack, while the gunfire also consumed the lives of another fifth of the military personnel.<br><br>At this point, the goal of the Icers was no longer to halt the Mokan incursion, but rather, to slow it down to facilitate a stronger response. As had been done in Logow to prevent Macabean expansion, minefields were constructed in the West of various cities as to prevent further expansion; while existing military bases were placed on high alert to immediately respond to any attack on their cities. First, this occured in Hoggrad with immediate priority; then in Oakmouth, and finally in Foxstead.<br><br>When news arrived in the border that this was complete, the Ice forces were already heavily devastated, and the bordering area was securely and irreversibly in Mokan control. Therefore, the Ice forces were, for the first time in history since the founding of the Empire of the Ice States, ordered to surrender to the invaders.
