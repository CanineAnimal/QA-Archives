Meanwhile, the Empire had a strong disadvantage at this point. Firstly, the Empire not only had to contest CFA advances, but also the invasions by the Golden Throne, Holy Marsh, and People's United Federation, thus forcing the Empire to confront four threats at once. Secondly, the CFA occupation severely hinders the ability of the Empire to deploy military resources; with extensive supplies in Southport City and Cruxhampton being in full CFA control; and with the occupation of Cruxhampton preventing any military resources or personnel from Stonegrad from being transported elsewhere by land.<br><br>Yet, it was no time for complacency: and in any case, it would be important to seize the opportunity now before it became too late, and the CFA lost its advantage over the Empire. With the CFA having now received a response from Holy Marsh affirming that they would intervene in Valenpool, the next target would be Redwell.<br><br>The CFA moved Westward ostensibly with little resistance. Yet, by now, the most likely tactic of the Icers to defend the city would be obvious: the placing of a minefield on the Eastern parts of Redwell to make invasion more difficult. If the CFA attempted to move Southward to avoid the minefield, the Empire could destroy their forces from the area with which they maintain control. Yet, in these areas, there would be fewer defensive measures. Capturing Redwell was more so an effort in logistics than any actual strong challenge to the CFA forces.<br><br>Even immediately as the CFA forces approached, little military force was even required. The Ice forces were fueled by low morale, at this point, and heavily outnumbered; the weaponry seized, and personnel recruited, throughout the process of the March of July, along with the great supplies of weaponry provided by the People's United Federation, served as a weapon for fear and intimidation as effectively as as a direct attack weapon. When the Ice forces realised this, having already been decimated in a few minutes by the CFA attackers -- despite ironically being the first to strike, attacking the CFA on sight -- their response was immediate surrender.<br><br>Now, when the CFA made its way to Redwell, the first means of attack was land invasion; with Ice ground forces being targetted by the CFA on sight. With the CFA's far more organised formation, they made for difficult targets for the Icers, such that CFA losses were truly minimal. In the air, the Ice forces barely had any sovereignty over the airspace; such that air invasion was simple, with the Redwell military airbase likewise being fired upon with dozens of missiles as to result in its prompt destruction and preventing any further attempts by the Icers to seize the airspace.<br><br>The Ice forces refrained from surrendering; yet even so, the low morale of Ice soldiers was evident. It was little of a struggle, and, in a matter of a few hours, the city was now fully in CFA control. Now, with this also fell the Duchy of Redwell; which managed national finances and treasury. In other words, the CFA now had full control over the Empire's spendings. While Ice loss was already clear, this occupation burned and salted any possible chance that the Empire would remain in power.</div>

<div class="content">As expected, the Ice States Navy fought aggressively. They launched waves of missiles to counter the waves of missiles the Marshites fired. Defensively, the Marshite Navy had invested heavily in a defensive arrangement and worked well within a well-established defensive doctrine that emphasized wide data sharing and advanced missile defense. The sheer number of missiles fired by the Ice States in their initial volley- their naval commanders having likely calculated that the Marshites were going to win the naval war- was extensive and impressive. It was expected that many enemies would try to target the larger and more 'important' vessels, but this was often unwise as they sat in the deepest and most well-defended parts of the Fleet. Instead, the meat of the attack fell on the rings of defense itself. While the defenses were still very tight, they did lead to more losses than expected. The most notable vessel that was sunk was the TMN Uriah Carrier VL, a Kazatlan-class escort carrier. Gun engagements between the meat of the Ice States fleet and the TMN were not likely due to the range of the missile fire, but there were indeed smaller gunbattles between the smaller Marshite vessels and more isolated Ice States naval vessels.<br>Search and Rescue Wings were already prepped as the battle began and moved quickly- casualties were higher than hoped for but well within the expected range, and the Search and Rescue teams worked feverishly to save as many as possible. In the air, the anti-air defenses of the Ice States navy did not prove too terribly strong thanks to the sheer size of the attack. Anti-air defenses that were emplaced on ground territories adjacent to the zone that engaged would be easy to destroy. The Ice States aircraft that took part were vastly outnumbered, meaning air dominance was rather quickly obtained. As such, the threat posed by the Ice States' aircraft to the Marshite navy was zeroed out quickly into the battle. The same was true of the submarines; with only fifty submarines taking part, they were easy enough to isolate and hunt down before they could participate meaningfully.<br><br>With the skies and the darkened seas owned by the Marshites, there was no place for the Ice States naval forces to truly escape. The overwhelming waves of Marshite missiles- attacking at different speeds, angles and heights- were supplemented now by free-roaming submarines and aircraft squadrons. The battle was short, bloody, and decisive. While it had cost the Marshites more than they would like to admit by the sheer aggressiveness of the Ice States, that same style had likewise meant that the Ice States' naval form would cease to exist in any meaningful capacity in a short time. Operations Green and Tone would be declared successful ahead of schedule, and their aircraft were freed up for other operations.<br><br>Cleansing Scent faced their own difficulties. The anti-air missile defenses were rough, as expected, and many non-stealth air wings took their expected heavy casualties. This was accompanied by a large number of remote aircraft in the airspace. Of course, throughout the conflict, the remote aircraft had proven relatively ineffective and this remained the case, and the advanced electronic warfare of TMAF started to find increasingly effective ways of interfering and even shutting down their control systems and devastating their combat capability. And as the air defenses on the ground opened up, they became easy prey for stealthed aircraft. The initial waves of attacks were met with higher-than-expected casualties, but as airbases were struck and destroyed, radar and communication systems were eliminated, and air defense systems neutralized, more and more of the airspace started to fall under the control of TMAF. Only a few airbases managed to limp along for a while, with Emerstead, Sandford, and Wintercourt proving hard targets. But soon their defenses would be destroyed and the bases themselves turned to shattered craters of their former selves. Once that was done and the airspace was in control, they would start targeting all military infrastructure and forces, reducing and destroying the Ice States military by any means necessary.<br><br><br>Sinboro Pony was, indeed, a very bold attack. The initial wave of missiles was launched far enough away that the naval forces attached to Operation Tone were considered sufficient to deal with them, though the losses sustained earlier hampered them more than expected. The decision was made to focus more so on the incendiary missiles over the chemical missiles, since there was a strong belief that they could contain such a weapon and return to normal operations more so than if the facilities underwent significant damage due to fire. Damage was severe in outlying areas and reduced as areas of importance were prioritized. The 1st Ixanan Militia Crusade had already been activated for military operations on the island and the 1st Ixanan WMD Response Group sprang into action, working with the Inquisition and the Marshite Nuclear Biological and Chemical Response Department to handle the situation.<br><br>Following the missile attack came the air attack. Of course, in order to get close to the island they would need to contend with the naval and naval air forces of Operation Tone, and as they got closer to the Ixanan coast, several coastal defense fleets. Aircraft from Operation Stale Tone were also tossed into the engagement. Above these fleets would fly the 4th Fighter Division and several additional wings of Fighters on station. All in all, some ten to twelve thousand fighters were able to maintain a constant presence over the airspace, aided by the layered air-to-air defense of Ixana and the naval vessels involved. All the while, operation Cleaning Scent would be able to hammer the airbases and supply centers, the communication facilities and command centers of the Ice States. Sinboro Pony was bold, but it split the weakened Ice States defensive forces up far too much, and essentially ceded control of the skies to the Marshites- and, in short order, would see Sinboro Pony throttled in its infancy.<br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="M-SAD CASUALTY TRACKING" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">(M-SAD MILITARY CASUALTY TRACKING NOTES THE FOLLOWING KNOWN LOSSES:<br><br>Casualties in Area of Operation: Green<br>1 Escort Carrier sunk<br>6 Cruisers sunk<br>13 Destroyers sunk<br>11 Frigates sunk <br>10 Fast Assault Craft sunk<br>2 SSK Sunk<br>30 Aircraft Lost<br>19 Helicopters lost<br><br>Casualties in Area of Operations: Stale<br>5 Cruisers Sunk<br>14 Destroyers Sunk<br>13 Frigates Sunk<br>6 Fast Assault Craft Sunk<br>1 SSK Sunk<br>36 Aircraft Lost<br>10 Helicopters lost<br><br>Casualties suffered during Operation: Cleansing Scent<br>18 MISB-03 Stalkers<br>190 MIHD-11 Hammers<br>65 MIHD-16 Talon Banes<br>200 MIHB-16 Mailed Fists<br>619 MAF-52 Griffons<br>290 MAF-50 Pegasus <br>65 MAF-50s Silent Pegasus<br>112 LY910 Shadowhawk<br>420 Support Aircraft<br><br>Casualties suffered during Sinboro Pony Defense Operation<br>1 Hood-class Supercapital Ship damaged<br>2 Arsenal Ships sunk<br>1 Escort Carriers Sunk<br>6 Cruisers<br>9 Destroyers<br>11 Frigates<br>21 Corvettes<br>9 Fast Assault Craft<br>680 Aircraft- 15 MAF-50S, 25 LY910 Shadowhawk, 150 MAF-50, 300 MAF-52, 190 Support.<br>89 Helicopters<br><br>Analysis: HIGHER THAN HOPED BUT WELL WITHIN THE EXPECTED RANGE.

UPDATED WITH KIA, WIA, MIA FIGURE OVER TIME.)</div></div></div><br><br><br>*******<br><br>Once the Icer attack on Ixana had been dealt with, Operations Burrow Nest, Green Sun, and Tone Setter commenced in support of Operations Cured Green and Stale Tone, the north and south invasions of the Ice States.<br><br>Landing forces would arrive by Tigershark LCAC and MGV-02 Warbeach Ekranoplanes, both pieces of hardware using the available battlespace network to lay down their own withering support fire before landing. They would be accompanied by vast swarms of LA-214 Moliors and ATH-30 Rocs dropping off forces to support the invasion. MV-44A Etolian Pegasi dropped off large numbers at once, but were mostly used to drop off cargo for the invasion force. MAH-70 Kingmakers and EV-48 Etolian Gryphons provided close-in support, along with the Rocs after they dropped off their squads. They were supported by the naval forces assigned to Stale Tone and Tone Setter, as well as the air force operation of Burrownest. The result was tens of thousands of aircraft in direct support, thousands of helicopters, and devastating naval fire support to aid the Marshite invasion to take and hold ground. The ground forces themselves would be tremendously aggressive in seeking out Ice States military forces, either to defeat them on their own terms or to pin them down for support elements to liquidate them. Airborne forces from VTOLs and helicopters would continually work to outpace the advance, trying to slow down, cut off, defeat, and pin down defending forces to try and cause maximum casualties. If the Ice States tried to defend the landing zones or anywhere within range of them, they would come under unrelenting fire from the sea and skies, and then from ground forces as they landed. Vast armored columns and mechanized forces were now on the hunt, supported in addition with the above by tens of thousands of pieces of artillery as the ground forces expanded their zone of control.<br>Once the beacheads were secure, the navy would move to set up a strong logistical base for the push as well as bringing on shore the majority of forces. <br><br>Landing Zones Aardvie to Azenia encompassed the westernmost element of Operation: Stale Tone, known as Sub-Operations Stale Tone 1-3. Forces allocated to Stale Tone 1-1 had a primary target of Foxstead, where they would work with the PUF when they arrived. The main bulk of the force would continue north while Operation Stale Tone 1-2 would move north-east, while Stale Tone 1-3 involved forces on the flanks to clear gaps and create blocking positions to keep the main thrusts safe. Operation Stale Tone 2-1 was the direct assault on Wintercourt itself. This thrust would be made up of several dozen of the most well-trained and experienced mountain and urban divisions, while Stale Tone 2-2 was a movement around the city to encircle it. Stale Tone 3-1 was the defensive effort of the landing zones while Stale Tone 3-2 was the general sub-operation for smaller offensive actions to clear the flank and expand control of the coasts and coastal security depth.<br><br>Landing Zones Badam through Bzarjaca encompassed the central portion of Operation Stale Tone, known as Sub-Operations Stale Tone 4-6. Stale Tone 4-1 was the thrust from the landing zone to Magecastle, moving through the cities of Sandford and Fortburg along the way. Stale Tone 4-2 was an offshoot offensive on the western side of 4-1, meant to clear enemy forces of the main thrust and then push off into the northwest after Sandford. Stale Tone 5-1 was targeted and Redwell, with 5-2 being a minor offensive towards Emmerstead and 5-3 being a flank-clearing operation. Stale Tone 6-1 was the defensive operation of the beach zone and 6-2 a series of small offenses to clear the flanks and expand control of the coasts and coastal security depth.<br><br>Landing Zones Calia through Czajac encompassed the eastern portion of Operation Stale Tone, known as Sub-Operations Stale Tone 7-9. Stale Tone 7-1 was the march up the western side of the Valenpool river, including a direct assault on the city itself. 7-2 was the first offshoot headed towards Emmerstead and flank clearing, while 7-3 was another flank clearing heading towards Redwell. Stale Tone 8-1 was the landing on the CFA-controlled side of the river, where they were aiming to support the CFA directly as well as handle various logistical and administrative tasks, as well as provide direct aid to civilian populations. Stale Tone 9 was the beachhead defense operation and several offensives designed to clear the flanks and expand control of the coasts and coastal security depth.<br><br>One day after Operation Stale Tone, Operation Cured Green commenced in much the same manner. Landing Zones Dasen through Dynas encompassed the northeast of Cured Green and involved Cured Green 1-3, Cured Green 1 was the name of the landings in the northeast near Stonegrad, with 1-1 being the main thrust into the city itself and 1-2 being an offensive to the southeast and of the city to close it off. These forces were expected to work quickly with the CFA, and were tasked with crushing the main imperial holdings nearby. Cured Green 2-1 was the attack towards Valhaven, which would come from the ground overland and the mountains and then supported by Cured Green 2-3- the direct amphibious invasion of the city. Cured Green 3-1 was the active defense of the beachhead and its expansion efforts, including offensives up and down the coastline and flank clearing.<br><br>Landing Zones Earser through Ezagas encompassed the central portion of Cured Green and involved sub-operations Cured Green 4-6. Cured Green 4-1 was the main attack towards Redwell, with 4-2 being flanking movements. Cured Green 5-1 was a thrust towards Fortburg and 5-2 being flanking attacks to secure the advance. Cured Green 6 was the defense and expansion of the beachhead, meant to link with allied CFA forces where possible to develop further envelopment of forces.<br><br>Landing Zones Fakvir through Fyansae encompassed the western portion of Cured Green and involved Sub-Operations Cured Green 7-9. Cured Green 7-1 was the attack into Magecastle itself, with the intention of taking the city by force no matter how high the cost. Cured Green 7-2 were a series of small flanking attacks to the south to link up with other Marshite assaults and complete the multi-part encirclement of the majority of the nation. Cured Green 8-1 was a thrust into the direction of Siopia, taking Bannfolk along the way before continuing on into Oldwitch and linking with PUF forces and forces from Stale Tone. Cured Green 8-2 was a series of southern-facing offenses designed to encircle Magecastle after Bannfolk and connect in the meat of the nation, while Cured Green 8-3 would be active defense operations against Ice States intrusion from Ormont- while also prepping for a possible invasion of the land, should the Golden Throne ask it.</div>

<div class="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1bcVOmyjw" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Suffragette City.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City, The Ice States.</span><br><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;">(Ooc: This section is co-written with <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Holy%20Marsh">Holy Marsh</a>).</span><br><br>The first to speak in the meeting was Antony Black, the leader of the CFA. As the rest of the participants sat down, he introduced the meeting.<br><br>"I have called his meeting between the CFA and Holy Marsh to discuss the measures we shall take against the Empire of the Ice States. Now, as obvious, the Ice States has remained in a bloody civil war for months now. While we can all agree that the Empire ought to be destroyed, the current civil war still ought to be ended before more Ice lives are destroyed, both of civilians and the soldiers of the CFA. Therefore, I believe that the best way to deal with the regime going forward is to conduct a military coup d'etat of Stonegrad, as to formally destroy the Empire once and for all."<br><br>"Now, the CFA already maintains control of all territories South of Stonegrad, while Holy Marsh controls the entire coast around it. The Ice military cannot send or receive any resources or personnel from Stonegrad. In addition, Holy Marsh already controls the airspace over the city, preventing the Empire from engaging in any attempted defense from the air. Should the royal castle be surrounded by the CFA and Marshites, it would be simple to conduct a coup d'etat overall; and necessary to prevent the destruction of more lives."<br> <br>"I believe that such an operation would be best performed as a surprise attack on the castle, followed by the wholesale seizing of the city. This prevents the Empire from conducting any measures to attempt to repel the coup, unaware of its imminence. It pains me to have to suggest this as a means of military attack, but I believe that the CFA forces need disguise themselves as civilians from Stonegrad to be able to enter the city and thereby attack the castle. Then, the CFA may enter the castle, arrest the Emperor, and seize the castle wholesale. The temporary period of anarchy will allow for CFA forces to, upon seizing Stonegrad, establish a military administration, and then establish themselves in the parts of the Ice States which are not already under CFA administration -- namely Ormont, parts of Isborgir, Oldwitch, and Southport."<br><br>General Alessia Chakarsk spoke up when the CFA representative was done. "Marshite forces will soon be attacking the city itself. I assume there will be engagements in the approaches to the city as we bat away their feeble defense. This should give your people ample opportunity to get through their lines and capture the Emperor and the castle without major combat. Indeed, their command and control faculties are reduced to the level that a sufficiently quick strike should be able to do so. For this cause, I have been given authorization to offer you the direct aid of several special forces groups who are willing to work with you in seizing the castle and the Emperor. While this operation is ongoing, you may conduct your ground opersation using civilian cover to aid them. The city itself will fall soon afterwards regardless of whether it is you through this coup or through our invasion. As for the rest of the landmass, all territory we control through our invasion shall be considered part of your administration. We will conduct our security operations in these areas until you are ready to take over, and we will work with you to develop the appropriate means of administration."<br><br>Black waited for the Marshite General to finish, and was pleased by her response. Indeed, this certainly facilitated the plan. "It would certainly function well enough for Marshite forces to attack Stonegrad in general while the CFA can seize the Emperor and attack the castle. As to the territories currently controlled by Holy Marsh, we indeed do not mind Holy Marsh having the temporary ability to administer the territories until we can formally gain control and administer the areas. We will take a similar approach with the areas occupied by the PUF and TGT, in allowing these nations to administer the territories until they are transferred to our hands."<br><br>"Now, are there any more inquiries as to this plan?" The response was ostensibly an ominous silence, but concluded in an affirmative consensus from the rest of the participants. The plan was to begin soon, and the Empire was now imminently about to fall. The Empire would fall for "freedom for all".<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Valenpool, the Ice States.</span><br><br>In this city, the CFA had -- just a few weeks ago -- failed in its attempt to seize the city. Yet, Holy Marsh was now to finish off what the CFA had started in seizing Valenpool. The Ice response was, therefore, prompt, with their forces fighting with full aggression on the Marshites. Hundreds of Ice tanks targeted the Marshites on sight, while the nearby military base directly launched a stream of simoultaneous surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles upon the Marshite aircraft and ground forces. Yet, the Marshites now had an advantage due to their control over the airspace above Valenpool. The same occured in Magecastle, which was also closely guarded yet had Marshites maintain full airspace control.<br><br>The Ice forces were ordered to retreat to the offices of the Duchy of Valenpool, as well as the Magecastle Embassy Complex. Indeed, not only would the occupation of the latter be deeply ironic, as it was from those offices that the entire situation building up to this conflict began; but it would prevent the Empire from being represented at all in the World Assembly and severely hinder foreign relations. Marshite forces were fired upon on sight as they approached the offices, yet to little avail. Over the next few minutes, the Ice forces present were halved in number in Valenpool, and already lost a third of their forces in Magecastle.<br><br>The Marshite forces, despite the continued fire they were subject to, had no trouble seizing the offices of the Duchies of Valenpool and Magecastle. The cities soon fell to Marshite occupation, and the Ice fire ceased. No attack could remove the new administration over the cities, as well as nearly all of the areas of the Ice States targeted by the invasion.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>Motokata-Ice States Border <br></span><br><br>Up and down the border, Icean and Motokatan forces clashed. Explosions and artillery erupted along the border from the Sea of Faith to Firmador. In many places, the border forces were supported by 21st Army, Federal troops, or even Marshites doing the bulk of the pushing, but much of the border force was on its own. The Federal artillery and airstrikes may have struck first, but they struck deep behind the border at radar stations, AA emplacements, artillery batteries, and runways. The Icean response had been similar, although anticipated. Shells exploded on both sides of the border as planes fought in the skies for control and support missions turned chaotic as resources lost combat effectiveness. <br><br>In many places, it devolved into border guard vs border guard, a hundred Skirmishes along the border as guns from both sides finally opened up on each other. Many times, the initiative of first strike gave the Motokatans the edge to win the battle, and occasionally even take a few key locations near the borders, but a few went the way of the Ice States. In one case a platoon of Icean border guards managed to take a bridge 2 kilometers in Motokata before they received the surrender orders. Eventually, the border was under Federal control. It came at a cost though, many conscripts and professional soldiers stationed on the border were killed, either holding their positions, or advancing on well built defenses with this attack explicitly in mind. <br><br>While the PUF had nearly a million troops ready to invade, getting them across the border was going to take time. The infrastructure along the border had been highly militarized and the limited trade had been going through numerous checkpoints on both sides(at least when trade was allowed). Those checkpoints were now mostly destroyed, either by by Federal invaders, or sabotaged by Iceans during their retreats<br><br>Still, the first major Federal spearhead, the one aimed at Foxstead, managed to rally enough forces on the Icean side to continue advancing. The 98th Armored Division, 12th Naval Infantry Division, and the K-10th Motor Rifle Division were pushing ahead. Roughly 63 thousand troops were pushing deep to take land before the Iceans could rally any defense, but were slowed down by mines, sabotaged bridges and other creative traps left behind. In the South the Marshite 438th Crusade was also advancing well, with a similar amount of forces across. In the north, 21st Army, 2nd Corps had managed to get two Motor Rifle divisions across, as their armored division spearhead was slowed by the limited of crossing points still able to handle heavy armor. <br><br>In total, just under 200,000 troops were making in towards their objective cities, with another million Federal troops in reserve, slowly making across the remains of the border.</div>

<div class="content"><div style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px"><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">OPERATION NORTHERN FREEZE</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...regarding the besieged bases.</span></span><br><br>The koronel had expected the Icer forces to either attempt a southward breakout to link up with forces behind their own lines, surrender, or at least charge suicidally. Instead...they decided to stay put. Atmos was perplexed. But he didn't waste much time in trying to understand the enemy. Instead, he reorganized his brigade to tighten the noose around the base and its defending forces. The division &#8212; held in reserve &#8212; lent one of its batteries to him to continue plastering the area with 160mm artillery fire. Three mortar platoons were also committed to suppressing the area with 80mm mortar fire, while he moved up an independent mortar platoon attached to his headquarters company to add 120mm mortar fire to the mix. If the Icers wanted to be sitting ducks, he'd obliged them.<br><br>While the Icer infantry that had attacked from their bases and was now staying put were under a perpetual artillery and mortar barrage, Atmos tightened the perimeter around them. Three companies were reinforced with the rest of the mechanized infantry battalion and ordered to link up with each other and form a tight line. This was pushed forward, toward the battered Icers, until machinegun and rifle positions could engage the enemy's forward elements. This would force the Icers to engage back or continue to withdraw into a smaller and smaller area, which, in turn, would be more and more susceptible to the artillery barrage.<br><br>Tracking the progress of the battle from his mobile command center, Atmos imagined that the fighting was taking place along similar lines elsewhere where Icer base forces had attempted to sally.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...reconnaissance and surveillance forces in the rear.</span></span><br><br>Any modern army that had dealt with commando and infiltration forces in past wars knew to keep surveillance forces in the rear.<br><br>Leutstrategos Alfred Gal&#225;nt had been issued orders by corps HQ to provide most of these assets for surveillance behind the front lines, which would free up the frontline division reconnaissance forces to operate behind Icer frontlines. Many of his mechanized brigade forces were tied down around besieged bases or holding the major arteries within the occupied territory &#8212; a fact that limited the enemy's movement to specific corridors of approach, making it easier for surveillance assets to discover them &#8212;, and he allocated his air recon troop to surveil the rear space from the air through helicopter and drone assets. Alfred also ordered his cavalry troop to intensify patrols within his sector, while recommending brigade commanders to do the same within their own sectors. This was all standard doctrine for an experienced army like the Ejermacht. These measures were taken to give warning of things like the 'stealth divisions' that the Icers were trying to infiltrate into the Macab&#233;an rear.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Icer 'stealth divisions' managed to infiltrate deep into the Macab&#233;an rear. In Alfred's mind, that situation was actually rather favorable because these new Icer forces would also be cut off from resupply, they would not be able to withdraw their wounded, and they could be engaged by his reserve forces. It just meant that the enemy had condemned additional forces to a losing battle simply because they hadn't secured their lines of communication and resupply.<br><br>The general directed some of his divisional artillery and most of his divisional MLRS to break up these new enemy forces with heavy artillery and rocket barrages. He deployed three battalions of his reserve mechanized brigade to engage these forces with ample artillery support, root them out, and mop them up. As the Icer forces around the bases were roundly defeated, he'd reallocate some of the battalions within these brigades to join the mopping-up operation against the 'stealth divisions.'<br><br>In the meantime, he requested air support but the Laerihans rejected the request because they were concentrating their operations along the front line and the Icer rear. He'd have to do with his mechanized infantry and artillery, so he also decided to attach the armored company belonging to Koronel Gutes' brigade to his reserve brigade so that this too was available to break down the enemy commandos &#8212; especially because it was very quickly learned that these new forces were armed with just small arms and some small caliber artillery pieces. These were not forces equipped to fight a battle against a well-armed, combined-arms mechanized army. All considered Alfred was not too worried about this new development. He wondered what the Icers had done with all the military equipment the Macab&#233;ans had given them to modernize their armies after the debacle of their defense against the Czaslyudians. It appeared that they had done thing meaningful with it.<br><br>All the same, he warned corps headquarters that additional infiltration forces could be sent and requested the armored division be allocated towards helping with the mopping up. Again, this request was rejected. He would soon learn why. Anyway, then he recommended that the corps seek reinforcements from Komsektor VI in Nicaro. Later corps headquarters contacted him via division radio and confirmed that a light limikari brigade would be attached to the division for additional surveillance and reconnaissance duties in the rear. It would be available to him by 0800 hours the next day.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...the air campaign.</span></span><br><br>After the four squadrons of Seraphs conducted their attack on the enemy bombers, they returned to their bases in southern Nicaro. Surviving Lu-45s did the same after exhausting their missile load on the aircraft. Almost an entire squadron, 18 of the 144, was lost to enemy fire, their pilots either dead or drifting toward the ground after ejecting. Two additional Lu-45 squadrons had recently lifted into the air to replace the assets forming the combat air patrol at the edge of the frontline so that these too could return to base to refuel and restock their weapons. Any surviving enemy aircraft would be engaged by this combat air patrol, which operated over an umbrella of mobile surface-to-air missile batteries that opened up on the enemy now that the aerial battle had ended and the risk of hitting their own had decreased. One could see the bright flashes against the horizon, the pillars of fire and smoke, and the streaking missiles reaching for the clouds.<br><br>Once the Lu-45s and Seraphs returned to their base, it took about 20 minutes to refuel and restock. Some of the aircraft were reorganized among the squadrons, with six kept momentarily in reserve to replace further losses or otherwise wait for the arrival of reinforcements from northern Nicaro. Then they started to conduct an interdiction campaign against the Icer's command and control, air defenses, and infrastructure.<br><br>Flying low, the Lu-45s struck radar sites, known command posts, airfields, supply depots, missile batteries, and other targets of the like with the intention of disrupting the enemy's ability to defend against the offensive. These Hawks focused on targets just behind the front lines, while the Seraphs penetrated deeper into Icer territory taking advantage of its more sophisticated stealth features. In both cases, they were covered by the Lu-45 Hawks and, in the east, GLI-76s providing cover through the combat air patrol. In most cases, the air strikes focused on the areas around Wingcaster and Deephedge, the two immediate targets of the upcoming armored offensive.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...armored thrusts.</span></span><br><br>As the Icers threw into their 'stealth land divisions' and conducted their operations in the Macab&#233;an rear, and as the Ejermacht worked to contain these using their reserve forces, the Golden Throne readied to launch an armored operation to surround and capture two major cities in the north: Wingcaster and Deephedge.<br><br>The day following the intensification of Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, Operation NORTHERN BLIZZARD began. The 197th Armored Division, in the west, launched a concentrated attack along a narrow sector of the frontline in an attempt to pierce through it and break into the Icer rear in the direction of Wingcaster. In the direction of Deephedge, the 122nd armored division did the same. They were supported by their own organic armored infantry, but each division was also given a mechanized infantry brigade from each of the two frontline mechanized divisions in their corps. Working on data gathered during the previous day of fighting, they attacked along a weaker sector of the Icer frontline with the intention of pushing armored forces deeper into the rear to attack command posts, artillery bases, missile sites, radars, and generally disrupt the enemy's ability to sustain defensive combat. Pockets of enemy resistance would be surrounded and broken down by trailing infantry forces. In each direction, the armored forces were to travel in two main prongs with the objective of surrounding the two major cities and cutting them off from resupply and reinforcement.<br><br>Operation NORTHERN BLIZZARD commenced before the sun had a chance to rise in the east. Armored columns composed of Nak&#237;l 1A4s with their large 140mm main guns, interspersed with Type 52GT IFVs and Shalmaneser HAPCs, and supported by lighter HIM-TAC and G11 armored cars for reconnaissance, generated dust clouds as they crashed into Icer lines, with armored vehicles firing without pause and in all directions into enemy lines in a form of thunder run. The tanks would continue on without pause so as to not get bogged down, with any heavy enemy resistance isolated and contained by mechanized infantry forces.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...amphibious landing.</span></span><br><br>Concurrently with Operation NORTHERN BLIZZARD, Operation FREEZING BAY &#8212; named as such to keep within the effort of similar operational names &#8212; was launched. North of Deephedge, under heavy long-range offshore missile fire and GLI-76-conducted airstrikes, two brigades of naval infantry &#8212; Terkos, as they were called &#8212; landed on beaches near the border with Devonia. They were carried in by amphibious APCs while accompanied by amphibious tanks and other armored vehicles, including light-tracked reconnaissance vehicles of the G11 series.<br><br>To some extent, this attack was meant as a diversion to distract and pin down Icer defenses while Operation NORTHER BLIZZARD moved forward. But these naval forces also intended to disrupt the enemy's rear while ultimately linking up with their Ejermacht counterparts and securing sections of the area around Deephedge. When they came they would possibly assist in the taking of Deephedge as well, as ample infantry forces would be necessary if the Icers put up heavy resistance in the cities.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">...digital strike.</span></span><br><br>Outside of Fedoria, the city once known as Chinadenga, lay Barbok&#225;n Limikes 'Gudara.' Gudara was one of the largest Ejermacht bases in Nicaro, the largest outside of Fedoria &#8212; an area known for its 'violence' &#8212; for certain, and home to thousands of soldiers from across all corners of the Golden Throne. It served as the central hub for limikari peacekeeping operations in the local komsektor. Because the men here served long-term commitments, most would remain here for years, there were more liberties afforded to the men as far as their ability to connect with the wider world. As opposed to soldiers partaking in a specific operation, men and women here would be able to check their emails, use mobile phones, and connect with friends and family elsewhere. It, therefore, wasn't strange for Soldat Prim Gerri Karpalo to open his private email server to check it.<br><br>Gerri saw one particular subject line that stood out: MACAB&#201;AN INVESTIGATORS UNVEIL EVIDENCE OF NAZI SYMPATHIZERS WITHIN ICER MILITARY. The Nazis were always top of mind given the years of animosity between the Golden Throne and the Ordenite Reich culminating with the recent wars in Killia, Holy Panooly, Krasnova, and, here, Nicaro. He opened it up and followed the link. The page 404'd. He closed it back up and went back to his email. Little did he know that he had just downloaded a computer virus.<br><br>Obviously, soldiers like Gerri couldn't access the majority of military networks, especially with a personal device but also because only certain soldiers with certain ranks and clearances would be able to access different network segments. That did not even include the fact that certain networks could only be accessed by certain VPNs, which in turn screened requests and admitted those only from known secure sources relevant to the purpose of the network. But it would soon be found that this virus would infect private networks across Nicaro and the empire, shutting down cellular devices, personal computers, and other electronic equipment affected by what would be known as BLACKSEAT.</div></div>

<div class="content"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YSATKzZRP0" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">The Hitman.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Stonegrad, the Ice States.</span><br><br>The day had come. The Empire would fall today, on the 7th of October, 1418. But this was not evident from the moment that it would begin; indeed, it appeared as any regular morning in the war-torn city that morning. The damage of the chemical attack remained clearly visible; nearly all of the city's vegetation had died; stores had to shut down due to the damage; and the streets were still nigh-empty, apart from the beggars who had been put on the streets both by the Empire's long-term policies and the damage of the civil war. Little did they know what would come, as the CFA soldiers marched into the city disguised as ordinary civilians.<br><br>The CFA soldiers had, however, by now decided exactly where they had to go: the Stonegrad castle. While the Icers had, at this point, received the intelligence that this was likely to be the means for the new inbound attack, the preparation was indeed minimal; or at least appeared as such. Once again, the Ice soldiers had lost just about all of their morale by now; and would not be able to defend the Empire. Yet, as the CFA soldiers approached, they went on to identify themselves as members of the CFA to prevent the Icers from committing more atrocities on Stonegrad's civilians, the propaganda value of such potential atrocities notwithstanding; and to coerce the Icers to surrender. However, the prompt response was being fired upon, albeit weakly, by the Ice guards.<br><br><div style="float: left;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b8nz1XV.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div>This, now, would have facilitated a greater response by the Icers to deploy more forces; but this was not possible. The CFA forces had little trouble just breaking into the castle; the door was promptly shot down, and the castle raided. Yes, the CFA had lost many of its personnel in this confrontation. Yes, the Icers also suffered losses, but to a much greater degree than the CFA would throughout the raid. Especially when the Marshites already controlled the airspace over the city, the Empire's fall in Stonegrad at the hands of the CFA was patently not only certain, but imminent.<br><br>Yet, while entering the castle was relatively simple, it was in fact much more difficult to seize the castle from the inside for the CFA; and Ice guards had blocked all exits through which the CFA could enter to seize the Emperor and his staff. The CFA was therefore ordered to refrain from entering a prolonged gunfight; but instead attack strictly in self-defense, <span style="font-style: italic">except</span> to clear a pathway to the residence of the Emperor. By now, the floor was littered with bleeding bodies of the personnel of both the CFA and the Ice forces; but this would not deter the CFA. Camellia Przybycien almost came to this fate when she was fired upon right next to her neck; but she was too lucky for the Icers, who had missed the fire. She was not alone; by now, damage in terms of personnel lost to the CFA had slowed down drastically. It only took a few more gunshots for the necessary path to be created; even if the CFA were now to be pursued.<br><br>The strategy to get rid of the Ice pursuers took the form of the splitting up of the CFA forces into two: The first would be the vast majority, who would raid the residence of the Emperor and be tasked with capturing his person; along with the Divine Scribe and Prince. The second was a smaller, but more elite, group of CFA soldiers, who would kill the Ice pursuing soldiers as they approached. The corridor through which they would be pursued was promptly rammed shut, and the elite CFA soldiers would ensure that the Ice guards came nowhere close to the locations targeted by the attack, where the Emperor would be captured. The CFA had to act speedily; but if this plan worked, the Emperor would be alone in fighting the entire CFA in his personal residence within the castle of Stonegrad.<br><br>The CFA forces marched up, through the staircase, rather quickly but also in a rather organised fashion. All participants in the expedition now were sure of the means of the mission; yet, it was the duty of the leader of the expedition to make this exceedingly clear in a mission of such consequentiality. All instructions were reiterated, therefore, to all involved in the seizure of the Emperor. Seizing the Divine Scribe and Prince was, of course, a secondary mission; but the scheme for their seizure was also reiterated...<br><br>And as he finished, the door to the Emperor's residence -- or shards thereof -- fell right down to the floor. The Emperor's arrest had begun, as he was thrown right down to the floor, with a gun to his head, in a matter of seconds. The CFA was explicitly ordered not to kill his person; as Przybycien laid handcuffs on him and rendered a physical blow to drive the Emperor unable to physically respond, before he was stripped naked. Without the robes of the Emperor and his headwear declaring his dictatorship, he really did appear as any other ordinary, bald Ice man. But the mission was far from complete. Przybycien laid handcuffs and foot shackles on the now-former Emperor, who she was now responsible for supervising with a small group of CFA soldiers, while the rest went after the Divine Scribe.<br><br>The Divine Scribe was granted the special religious ability to reside within the castle, to facilitate both the Order of Klyprer and its propaganda value for the Empire, and the use of Klyprer and speedy "consultation" of "Klyprer's" "will" in government decisions. Given the proximity of his residence to that of the Emperor's, it was little difficulty raiding his location. Yet, here who was being targeted was not a mass murderer, war criminal, and director of genocide; rather, a simple religious leader. As a result, the sole purpose of his arrest -- as with that of the Prince -- was to facilitate the formation of a new regime. He would not be facing trial or punishment in any form; and therefore, the approach to his seizure was far more peaceful than that of the Emperor.<br><br>Without even needing to be asked for it, the Divine Scribe immediately surrendered to the CFA forces. He did not need to be arrested; yet, for the sake of security, he was still handcuffed, while this process was permitted by the religious leader. He was then peacefully escorted to the Emperor's room, where all arrested individuals would be kept for the time being. Yet, the mission still had not concluded. The CFA forces had now received news of the corridor to the residencies of the Divine Scribe and Emperor being cleared. Accordingly, they moved down to the room of the Prince of Stonegrad. He was also given the option to surrender to the CFA forces, or to enter a prolonged gunfight with dozens of trained soldiers against himself alone.<br><br>The Emperor and Divine Scribe were then escorted down, upon the few guards present at the Emperor's room being alerted of the progress of the mission to arrest the Prince of Stonegrad. When the mission was complete, with the Prince being arrested safely without significant damage to either himself or the CFA forces, they were then transported over in a CFA vehicle -- which had also been disguised as a civilian vehicle during the infiltration of the city -- to Cruxhampton, which by now was so firmly in CFA control that a new Ice military base could be constructed in the city. The day had finally come: the Empire had fallen to the CFA. It was now, simply, a matter of establishing a new government. Promptly, the Ice administration in other locations fell with the seat of government in Stonegrad; forces in Ormont, Oldwitch, and otherwise combatting invading forces throughout the Ice States ceased fire in a matter of hours. Meanwhile, the nation's new capital city was no longer Stonegrad, but rather Southport City: the home of the CFA and the second city to fall to its administration. The temporary leader of the Ice States was Courtney Hazelbush, who was second in the CFA's command chain and the most knowledgeable on civilian government. Finally, the Green-Tailed Parrot was the new national animal of the Ice States, as opposed to the Ice eagle, representing the cessation of the imperialism of the Empire.<br><br><sub>(Ooc: Edited once to fix a spelling error, then to fix coding for this disclaimer.)</sub></div>

<div class="content"><div style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px"><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE GREEN ZONE, ICE STATES</span></span><br><br>Just as operations in the north were reaching their climax, the Icer military surrendered its weapons and raised its hands.<br><br>Operations NORTHER BLIZZARD and FREEZING BAY began in the early morning hours before the sun's first rays could creep over the horizon. Hundreds of tanks and other armored vehicles punched through the enemy's lines expecting an intensification of resistance. At first, that was precisely what happened. The Icer military put up a wicked resistance that put the Ejermacht's mailed fist to the test. Tens of thousands of missiles, bombs, rockets, and shells rained down upon the enemy in a torrent of steel and fire in order to soften their ability to defend themselves. As it turned out, it was all overkill.<br><br>When the first Icer soldiers began throwing up their arms their Macab&#233;an counterparts naturally believed that they had succeeded in putting the enemy under so much pressure that he was giving up. It was only later in the day that the news of the emperor's capture by the communists began filtering through the Fuermak's ranks. And as this fact gained broader realization the impetus to accelerate operations to occupy the Green Zone fully gained intensity. Although Emperor Sotolo's fall brought some certainty in the fact that the Icer military had ceased resisting, there was newfound uncertainty in how quickly the communist victory would solidify and what the communist victors would do regarding resisting the Macab&#233;an-imposed Green Zone in the north. It was therefore imperative for the Ejermacht to complete the occupation before the communists could consolidate and turn their attention to the northern invaders.<br><br>The great armored thrusts toward Wingcaster and Deephedge continued, but the infantry was moving along at a similar pace behind them now that the Icers were no longer resisting. Those who surrendered were gathered and sent northward, bussed up into southern Nicaro to fill up temporary prisoner-of-war camps until they could be released back into the Ice States. There, within these camps, they were housed in large barrack buildings containing rows upon rows of bunk beds. All of the accoutrements of a civilized prisoner-of-war policy were provided, including ample food, medical care, and a fairly liberal policy of socialization and exercise. It was fully expected for these conditions to be transient, with these captured soldiers returning to their homeland as soon as possible. In fact, their guards mingled among them with instructions to discuss the new political order arising in the Ice States, what they thought of communism, and finding anti-communists among their ranks. The Macab&#233;an political machinery already had an eye on what seemed like the inevitable near future: the creation of an anti-communist movement in the Ice States to effect a transition to something else, whether that be a capitalist-leaning military dictatorship or &#8212; ideally &#8212; democracy.<br><br>The political game was a nascent one in any case and the focus now was still militaristic in nature. From Wingcaster and Deephedge, which streets soon filled with imperial infantry riding their heavy armored personnel carriers and autocannon-carrying infantry fighting vehicles, the Golden Throne's military machine continued southward toward Logrow and the borders of Oldwitch. Toward the west, it sought to seal the frontier with Devonia and in the east with Motokata. These operations were somewhat hampered by the Icer military's policy of mining the approaches to Logrow and elsewhere. The Ejermacht of course attempted to extract all the information it could from its prisoners of war, but the advance moved so quickly that this information often didn't come fast enough. Instead, tanks and other vehicles were lost even as the Icers ended their resistance. Mine-clearing vehicles were called up to open corridors through which the advance could continue. In this fashion, the occupation of the Green Zone was finalized. After days of a series of intense battles in Ormont, Operation NORTHERN FREEZE was finally coming to a satisfactory conclusion. Satisfactory for the Golden Throne, of course.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">MACABEA, PROVINCE OF D&#205;ENSTAD</span></span><br><br>As the fighting unfolded during the previous days, other moves were being made in what was commonly known as the 'financial capital' of the Golden Throne. Macabea had once been the political capital of the Kingdom of D&#237;enstad. That was before it had been shifted to Fedala in a symbolic move to provide a new capital city for a new empire. Still, Macabea's importance had only seemed to grow after the seat of political power went elsewhere. With the expansion of the imperial economy and its burgeoning role as the center of regional capital and trade currents, Macabea's vitality rose along with it. Tall buildings made of steel, concrete, and glass multiplied like blades of grass, towering over a commercial port that now extended beyond what the eye could see in both directions of the coast. The water in the bay and beyond was now dotted black, like a colony of ants, with ships of all sort &#8212; warships, but more so cargo and petrol ships bigger than any man-of-war anyone had ever seen. These carried millions of tonnes of goods and wares every single day, bringing them in and sending them out alike. Trillions of r&#237;okmarks worth of Macab&#233;an goods were shipped out to exotic countries like Mokastana, Haishan, Lamoni, Eitoan, and now even Ralkovia (at least, Federal Ralkovia). And trillions worth came in from the same countries and more, to fill the homes of not just a Macab&#233;an middle-class flush with cash but also the ranks of Zarbians, Havenites, Guffingfordis, and countless others joining the imperial economy.<br><br>This financial world was one that the Golden Throne had tried to bring the Ice States into. As trade flows into Ormont flourished, wealthy Icers were incentivized to open accounts in the Golden Throne. The Golden Throne had a history of financial liberty. It had enormous capital markets with proven results in capital gains. In this capitalist paradise, Icers could safely store their wealth, guarantee that it would never be touched by a greedy totalitarian government, and see it grow without an ounce of effort. And with the opening of an enormous credit line to the Icer imperial government of Sotolo, it was that very government that had sent wealth in the other direction to help grow its own accounts so as to repay this loan and make some money on top of it.<br><br>With the looming threat of a communist regime in the Ice States, the Imperial Bureaucracy had no intention of threatening any capital that private Icer citizens had sent to the Golden Throne for protection. In fact, now the incentives for rich Icers to move their money into Macab&#233;an financial markets was greater than ever because the communists would surely collectivize whatever they could. Besides, there were ample legal protections through which the Imperial Bureaucracy would have to move through in order to even <span style="font-style: italic">attempt</span> to touch any of these accounts. Private Icer citizens who had nothing to do with their government's wrongdoings would still benefit from the full protections of the Macab&#233;an financial and legal system.<br><br>But the accounts associated with Sotolo and his government were easier to access. As soon as they became persona-non-grata within the empire the international case against them on humanitarian grounds gave the Imperial Bureaucracy the legal means to freeze their accounts. A legal suit was immediately brought to court and as the occupation of the Green Zone proceeded so did the 'occupation' of all Icer wealth associated with the old government and its cronies. Accounts belonging to the emperor, the aristocracy, and high-ranking military officials, and all others now persecuted for their actions under the previous regime were taken over by the Imperial Bureaucracy. Through the imperial court system, they sought to use this captured money to, first and foremost, repay the credit line extended to the Ice States during the Czaslyudian crisis and after. And then, as a secondary priority, to flow into the imperial treasury as a form of repayment for the investments made to facilitate expanded trade flows into Ormont. It would be a long and arduous legal process, as that was the nature of the Golden Throne's system &#8212; a process made necessary by the very institutions that made the Golden Throne an economy worth investing into. But with the relevant accounts frozen, time was on the Imperial Bureaucracy's side.</div></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">12th Naval Infantry Division <br>Lead elements <br>Foxstead, Ice States</span><br><br>Sergeant Simon Javier raced into the storefront on the right side of the road as the bullets began flying. Just 10 meters ahead of where he had been, bullets and shrapnel ricocheted off his squad's MAV-31 Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The ambush began the moment a mine had blown off the MAV's left track, and now the vehicle was stuck in the middle of the road. A rocket fired from a window, too close to be engaged by the MAV-31's defenses, struck the armored vehicle and roared into the winter air. No doubt the enemy expected that explosion to mean a successful kill, but the IFV's 30mm cannon replied before the ball of flame had subsided. Five rounds of high explosive shells tore into the building, shredding whatever existed inside. <br><br>"Report. Squad 2. Contact. MAV2 immobile. Returning fire!" Sergeant Javier yelled into the Platoon wide comms channel before switching back to his squad's:<br><br>"Tomas, you better still be alive in there, respond!" Simon yelled into his microphone. In his ear the IFVs comms system responded. "So far Sarge!" From across the street Simon heard the familiar sound of belt fed 6.5mm JMC rounds being fired at a target. "Chen, is your fireteam alive?" <br><br>"Yes Sargo! Mickey took a stray in the leg, but we're patching him up." <br><br>Mickey was the squad's First Aid Specialist, carrying the trauma kits and other spare bandages that would no doubt come in handy after this conflict. Simon swore to himself off the radio before responding.<br><br>"Everyone! Send reports of target locations!"<br><br>"Aye Sargo! Report, right side of MAV. Two stores up the street, 3rd floor. Marcus is suppressing." The belt fed machine gun roared again, no doubt Marcus doing his best to keep the ambushing party suppressed. Simon barked back a quick "Understood" before looking for his Grenadier Mayor, Akamai, the leader of his other fire team. Akamai had run into the store front ahead of him along with most of his fireteam. All except for Sarah, the marksman, who was now pinned down behind the IFV. <br><br>With a soldier still in the street, Simon barked in the radio once more. "Tomas, pop smoke!" Within a second, a cloud of IR inhibiting smoke engulfed the street from the MAV's remaining smoke grenades, blinding the ambushers. Simon looked out the window to ensure the streets were blind, then yelled out: "Sarah, get your ass over here!" In his ear Akamai's voice carried over the radio: "Report. Chen, one storefront up from you, 3rd floor. Unknown number." No doubt Akamai had been looking for details before the smoke popped and therefore reported only the location, as that's all he had. <br><br>Sarah jumped through the broken window, and took cover behind the counter with Simon. Another rocket exploded on the MAV, a fireball glowed in the smoke filled street, no doubt more explosive reactive armor going off as the 30mm chain gun returned fire. <br><br>"Akamai, Chen, pull back and put forties on targets across the street. Level those fucking buildings." <br><br>"A team in the blast zone. Cannot see the target across the street. "<br><br>"B team clear of targets. Cannot see the target." <br><br>"Chen fucking send them anyways, then pull back. Akamai, pull back to me. Tomas, Jorge, spike the IFV and evac."<br><br>Unfortunately, the smoke worked both ways. Yet both sides continued to spray machine gun fire indiscriminately. Another ambush rocket missed the MAV and exploded in a building behind them. From across the road Simon heard the familiar THUN-THUN-THUNK of a three grenade rounds launched electronically in quick succession. Somewhere up ahead in the road, the grenades made contact with a building and explosions reverberated down towards the street. Civilian infrastructure was not designed to handle three 40mm HEDP grenade explosions, and the sounds of a building collapsing into the street could be heard.<br><br>Simon had higher priorities than knowing if a building hit went down, or even confirming it was the hostile one. He and Sarah smashed through a side door and fell into an alley where Akamai and his fireteam was firing, blinding, behind them and pulling back. Taking cover behind a dumpster, Simon aimed at the building targeted by his fireteam, as rounds ripped it apart, centimeter by centimeter. "Go go go!" He yelled while unloading his magazine as covering fire. Akamai shot through a locked door and swept the room inside, finding a way out from the engagement. <br><br>"B Team has an exit."<br><br>As Akamai's fireteam provided covering fire for Simon he raced into the building behind them, and once he was behind cover barked into the mic:<br><br>"A Team, V team, report!'<br><br>"A team. We're pulling back. Two wounded. We have V team. We're stuck on this side of the road but concealed." <br><br>"Stay close to the road, and find cover."<br><br>"Aye Sargo."<br><br>Turning back to the fireteam Simon was with, he formulated a plan to get his squad back together. "We're going to be crossing the road. Patrick, get that LMG in position to provide covering fire when we do. Sarah, follow Patrick and find something for Akamai to drop his forties on. Let's move out."<br><br>"Aye Sargo." They responded as he made his next call: "Report Squad 2, MAV2 spiked, ambush found. Two wounded. We're split along the road."<br><br>"Understood. MAV3 moving up for fire support. Platoon Medic on standby."<br><br>"Palov to Javier, report distance and direction from MAV2 to ambush forces."<br><br>Palov was the Platoon Leader, about a block back, with command of two other squads and the ability to call down company and battalion level assets. Javier responded to the best of his ability, but the ambushers were spread out down the road. It was a vague estimation at best. In response, Platoon Leader Sergeant Minor Palov requested a mortar strike on the possible locations of enemy forces from the company's mortar unit. <br><br>While MAV2 had been spiked and abandoned by its crew, it was not out of the fight. Not that it could fire, as spiking it involved detonating a shape charge into the remote weapon system and driving a pressurized wedge into the gearbox, but it still had its sensor suite. Broadcasting to the PUF's BattleNet its Damocles satellite based location, along with any remaining camera feeds. This way it could still act as eyes and ears for PUF forces. Normally this was so that Federal forces could call in artillery or air strikes on abandoned military hardware, or if they chose, hold the fire mission until the enemy was actively trying to capture it and take a few extra with it. <br><br>With the location of one object on the battlefield known, the guesstimates for targets could be calculated. About 50 meters away from the MAV, eight 80mm mortar shells would impact the streets and shops along the road, simultaneously, about 30 meters further, another eight rounds would impact. While high explosive 80mm mortar rounds normally had a kill radius of 35 meters in open terrain, urban terrain was unpredictable. Walls and furniture could either become shrapnel, increasing lethality, or be solid enough to protect something that needed to be destroyed. To be sure of target destruction, more was better. <br><br>It would be unknown if the mortar strike actually killed anyone, but it would make it clear the Federation had the ability to respond overwhelmingly to threats. As the MAV3 moved up to pop smoke and reunite Javier's squad, a message popped up on the battle net radio:<br><br>"Attention: Icean leadership has ordered their forces around Foxstead to surrender. Expect surrendering forces and remain on high alert. Battalion commanders may set up temporary POW holding centers where needed."<br><br>Javier felt a slight tinge of relief that the fighting in the city might soon end, but little did he know that it was the war itself that was coming to an end.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">FEDERAL OCCUPATION OF THE ICE STATES</span><br><br>Over the coming weeks over a million Federal troops would pour into the Ice States, with military engineers rebuilding the destroyed border stations to be much more open to traffic, allowing more troops and supplies to cross over. <br><br>The forces moving to capture Oakmouth would continue on their mission, but they would be followed by the rest of the 2nd Corp of the 21st Army, who moved on to perform encirclements of targets the Federation did not want to challenge yet. Eventually the northern front would be reinforced by the 4th Corps of the 17th Army from Aqua Anu, while the middle push would eventually utilize the Wellovian 2nd Corps of the 15th Army to occupy captured territory. <br><br>The PUF knew the Marshites and themselves would be turning over their captured territory to the new communist government, and likely be propping it up, but there was still the Golden question. The Golden Throne had financially supported the old Emperor, and as such had debts to collect on, and territory in their hands. Emperor Fedor was a good poker player, and right now he had a good hand to go with it. It was unlikely the Golden Throne would want to create a new puppet state in their occupied territories, but they would probably be asking for a lot from the new communist regime in exchange for it back. <br><br>Just to be safe, priority was shifted from the center of the country to the north, to occupy territory quickly and establish a new border with the TGT occupied territories. No doubt it would eventually fall somewhere around the border between Ormount and Oldwitch.</div>

As a result, the rest of the Ice States which was not under occupation of the PUF, Holy Marsh, or the Golden Throne quickly also fell to CFA control. Yet, there was still a problem obstructing the CFA's full sovereignty over the Ice States: the Golden Throne's invasion of Ormont. The Golden Throne's response to the fall of the Empire was not to withdraw and allow the areas to come under CFA control; but rather to increase aggression and speed up the invasion. Of course, the now-CFA forces remained ordered noto to contest the occupation; but instead a diplomatic wire was promptly sent to the leadership of the Golden Throne, as follows. Going to war with the Golden Throne would be a poor choice for a newly-formed regime; hence a peaceful resolution was sought.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">From: The Communal Union of the Ice States<br>To: The Ruling Leadership of the Golden Throne<br><br>To whom it may concern,<br><br>As information has likely reached your nation by now, the Empire of the Ice States was indeed just deposed, with the Emperor and relevant officials thereof having been captured and arrested by the CFA. The new regime, known as the Communal Union of the Ice States, therefore seeks a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing invasion of Ormont. Specifically, we would like to make two requests of the Golden Throne.<br><br>Firstly, we request if the Golden Throne would like to participate in a diplomatic conference with our nation, as to ensure that the interests of both us and the Golden Throne can be protected, and to prevent further loss of lives of both Icers and Macabeans as a result of the ongoing invasion.<br><br>Secondly, we request if the Golden Throne can cease invading any new territories in Ormont for the duration of the diplomatic proceedings. This would ensure that the battle does not cause bias or unnecessary hostility during said diplomatic proceedings. Further, while Ice troops are already refraining from further aggression towards the Golden Throne, we formally promise that should this request be granted, no military hostilities will be performed by the Communal Union towards the Golden Throne, including its forces in Ormont, for the duration of the diplomatic proceedings.<br><br>We look forward to receiving a prompt reply from your government.</blockquote><br><br>Once an affirmative response was received from the government of the Golden Throne, a meeting was promptly scheduled in Magecastle between representatives of the Communal Union and the Golden Throne. While the Communal Union had planned to eventually relocate diplomatic affairs to Southport City, the greater infrastructure at Magecastle meant that its use for diplomatic negotiations was still necessary, even if only temporarily. In addition, the scheduling of the meeting was not without its issues: the Golden Throne had declined the request that the invasion cease, which would be almost certain to make negotiation more difficult. Yet, the CFA's actions towards the Empire was not representative of how the Communal Union intended to deal with the Golden Throne: it would be extremely foolish for such a new regime to immediately go to war with a nation as powerful and influential as the Golden Throne. Therefore, the Communal Union would seek diplomatic resolution to the conflict at all costs...</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Meanwhile, throughout the Ice States.</span><div style="float: right;"><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iaXqyKR.png" alt="Image"></blockquote></div><br><br>With the Empire now deposed, the CFA's main goal was now to secure all areas of the Ice States outside of the Green Zone which were not under, or to be under, the control of the CFA's allies. The CFA forces began by extending their occupation in the Stonegrad peninsula, promptly seizing the entire peninsula along with Marshite forces, and thus keeping Stonegrad securely under CFA control.<br><br>Next, they would travel towards Fortburg and Sandford, which also were promptly occupied. They then split into two groups: one was smaller, and would go after Wintercourt, while the other would travel towards the Northwest, accordingly occupying the rest of Isborgir and Ormont up until the Green Zone.<br><br>The minefields surrounding Logow and Bannfolk indeed would go on to pose significant challenges to the CFA advances. These were avoided by approaching the cities from their Southwests. Once each was firmly in CFA control, the landmines would then be located, marked, and cleared. At this point, the sole purpose of clearing the minefields was to avoid them from hurting Ice civilians, with the cities already having been seized. The original plan of the imperial military in leaving the Southwest free from landmines was that they would force enemies to enter specifically in the highly-guarded areas, rather than try to enter the city from wherever. However, this tactic could no longer function with the imperial military defense already having collapsed wholesale as a result of the coup.<br><br>Now, it would merely be a matter of planning the next steps of how to deal with the remains of the Empire. Firstly, a set of new laws was drafted and passed, which would remain in place for the duration of the military occupation, ie until a permanent civilian regime could be formed. Notably, these laws guaranteed freedom of religion to all Icers, who were now permitted to hold and practice whatever religion they wished. However, the Order of Klyprer in particular remained under stringent government supervision -- in fact, the Divine Scribe could only operate under the direction and authority of the CFA. It was also decided that the Ice States would not yet become a World Assembly member, continuing to be represented under <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Magecastle%20Embassy%20Building%20A5">Magecastle Embassy Building A5</a> as a <span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span> separate member nation. Once the trials and extraditions of Imperial criminals was complete, the Ice States would then become a member for itself, and fully comply with World Assembly law as a member nation.<br><br>Next, various high-ranking Ice figures were to be tried for crimes against humanity. This was not only to deliver justice for those they wronged; but also for the propaganda value against the Empire of having their highest-ranking figures found guilty of crimes against humanity. CFA forces were dispatched to locate and arrest these figures, to render them to Southport City where the trial would commence. It was now only a matter of determining the ex post facto offences which they would be tried against, selecting witnesses, and producing extradition agreements with Holy Marsh and the Golden Throne to address war crimes committed against both, such that they would be allowed to punish the criminals however they wanted.<br><br>Finally, two statements were issued by the CFA vis-&#224;-vis the coup and the formation of the new regime. The first was one to be issued internationally, designed to secure a positive reputation for the Communal Union abroad earlier. It would also specify the Ice States' temporary plans regarding the World Assembly -- ie that it would not yet join as a member nation -- though it would not describe the plans of the Ice States to rejoin the World Assembly.<br><br>The second addressed all Icers, to ensure that the transition of power proceeded smoothly and free from unnecessary resistance. It read as follows<br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">My fellow Icers,<br><br>I am pleased to tell you today that the genocidal, totalitarian, and capitalistic Empire of the Ice States was finally destroyed, in a coup d'etat performed by the Communist Freedom Army and backed by Holy Marsh. All areas of the Ice States are now no longer under imperial control, being controlled either by the Golden Throne, or the CFA and its allies. I am therefore pleased to announce the formation of the <span style="font-weight: bold">Communal Union of the Ice States</span>.<br><br>This is an opportunity for a new government, a new regime, and a new nation. The corrupt, fascistic tendencies of the Empire, which persecuted an entire ethnic group on the basis of its nation being in conflict with the Empire, are now a thing of the past. And as a result, we have taken a number of steps to protect the freedoms of Icers throughout the nation. Of these, first and foremost, no religion shall be mandated by the state upon inhabitants of the fair nation. Yes, you are all free to worship whatever deity or religion you so choose to worship. In addition, the exploitation of the proletariat at the hands of the bourgouise is, likewise, a thing of the past. Corporations and private industries shall begin at once to collectivise themselves, as to convert to worker cooperatives ran by the proletariat. Further, the root source of greed, imperialism, and theft shall be abolished: money. It shall instead be used exclusively for trade with other capitalist nations, with our domestic economy being free from the use of money in any shape or form. Finally, all currently imprisoned or otherwise punished unjustly, such as for collective punishment, shall be freed immediately, with their criminal records expunged of said offences.<br><br>Now, these changes are likely not to be accepted by all. It is the right of all Icers to dissent against decisions by the government. However, one should also remember that these are troubled times. We are all Icers, and we should work together for a better nation; and resisting these changes will make it impossible to make it through these times. Regardless of whether you agree with these changes, collaboration and openness is the only way forward today.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Courtney Hazelbush,<br>Temporary General-President,<br>The Communal Union of the Ice States.</span></blockquote></div>

By now, with the entirety of the Green Zone being under Macabean control, the previous concerns by the Ice administration that the continued invasion would hinder the progress of the negotiations was moot, though not in the manner that the Icers desired.<br><br>Lara Surr, kr&#237;erlord to His Imperial Majesty Fedor I, responsible for overseeing federal imperial policy in the Satrapy of Nicaro and the states that were of interest to the Golden Throne through their relationship &#8212; whether geographical, linguistic, mercantile, et cetera &#8212;, arrived at Magecastle an hour before the meeting. Landing at the city&#8217;s international airport, after a short flight from Managua, she was taken via official car to the meeting site. Along with Lara came Jogornos Hiram Jelelope, who was assigned as the head of diplomatic mission to the Ice States. Hiram had experience, albeit with the old toppled imperial government, although all his former interactions had been done under the wing of Jogornos Derego Frogeder. This time he came alone, although subordinate to the kr&#237;erlord. They had spent long hours during the previous days aligning on what to say and what the acceptable outcomes out of his meeting were.<br><br>Many things had changed since civil war had first broken out in the Ice States. When the Fuermak first embarked on Operation NORTHERN FREEZE, it wasn&#8217;t expected for the imperial regime in the Ice States to collapse so spectacularly. In fact, it was expected for the imperial regime to cooperate, as that government would find safety in the Green Zone in the event of Marshite or Mokan intervention &#8212; intervention that would surely remove Sotolo from the throne. Alas, Sotolo and his advisors had turned out to be less prescient than the Golden Throne&#8217;s imperial government had thought, although perhaps they should have known better given how little thought Sotolo&#8217;s regime had put into things like the war with the Czaslyudians. Anyway, not only had Sotolo been removed from power, but a Communist regime was now in power and other areas of the country were under occupation by other foreign powers: the Mokans in the west and the Marshites in the south and southeast. The evolution of events changed the Golden Throne&#8217;s objectives in occupying the Green Zone area, at least with regards to the details. Now the Green Zone was so much more than an area under the security of the Golden Throne, where Icers could come and escape the war to the south, and where the nascent trade between the Macab&#233;an empire and the Ice States could continue to flourish. And no longer could it serve as the kernel of an Icer imperial revival, that possibility disappeared the second that Sotolo had determined to resist the Macab&#233;an occupation through the use of force.<br><br>Much of what the Green Zone meant to the Golden Throne, how it could be used to further imperial interests, would depend on the outcome of this very meeting. The empire&#8217;s primary interests, at the moment, were economic. The Czaslyudian and Ordenite blockade of the Ice States, and the consequent war, had opened up new trade horizons. Financial capital and capital goods flowed from the imperial provinces into the Icer northlands through the intermediary of Quitiruz&#250;, a once-backwater-fishing-harbor-turned-major-port-city through the power of the r&#237;okmark. But Icer military resistance to the initial occupation also meant that this primary objective was being matched by an objective of military importance. Macab&#233;an blood had been spilled on Icer territory. Macab&#233;an blood was not cheap. If the Icers came with the expectation of an easy negotiation ending with a Macab&#233;an withdrawal, they were in for a sore surprise. The intersection of both economic and military interests crossed where the Ice States had gone Communist. Communism was a threat to imperial trade interests in the northern Ice States. Handing the Green Zone back to a Communist regime was counterproductive, and would undoubtedly be interpreted as a betrayal by the military factions who had now lost some of their own in its taking.<br><br>With the context of these complexities and complications in mind, Lara Surr and Hiram Jelelope were driven to the meeting place. They said very little to each other on the car ride. They had already spent many hours together, there was little more to be said other than the upcoming conversation with their counterparts in the new Communist Icer government. It was in relative silence, then, that they awaited arrival.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Communal Union would be represented by three main figures. Firstly, was the General-President Courtney Hazelbush, who was second in the CFA's command chain and the most knowledgeable on civilian government, thus being appointed as the temporary leader of the nation during the military occupation. Secondly, was Lyda Straub, who was formerly a political scientist from Cruxhampton before being recruited into the CFA, and being selected as the temporary leader of the nation&#8217;s diplomacy. Finally, was Alexander Nicholas Saverchenko-Colleti, who by now had returned to the Ice States safe and sound, and was noted for his diplomatic demeanour such that he was likely to be an invaluable asset during the negotiations. Two diplomatic aides were also present, for the purpose of providing any necessary services to the diplomats present.<br><br>The Macabeans were allowed to arrive at the diplomatic airport, before being escorted to the negotiation room, at Magecastle Embassy Building A3, by the involved diplomats. The fate of the Ice States was already decided; but the fate of its member state Ormont in particular rested in this negotiation, this very day. The goals of the Ice States were clear: to ensure that the territories in the Green Zone were promptly returned, and to ensure that the Macabeans did not return, without spilling any more Ice blood.<br><br>Once all were sat down at the meeting table, Saverchenko-Colleti spoke. &#8220;Please make yourselves comfortable here &#8211; in addition, if anyone would like any drinks, they may be supplied by the Ice aides present.&#8221; Both Surr and Frogeder requested, and received, glasses of water. &#8220;We have called this meeting to discuss the fate of the territories in Ormont known as the &#8216;Green Zone&#8217;, which are currently under the military occupation of the Golden Throne. As you all likely know, the operation &#8216;NORTHERN FREEZE&#8217; commenced at the beginning of the national civil war resulted in the protection of the territories by the Golden Throne to keep them secure from the growing civil war; an operation responded to by the Empire with aggression, attempting to remove the territory&#8217;s guardians by force. And while we may rule over the same territories that the Empire did, in no way do we condone the behaviour of the Empire towards the Golden Throne.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;However, while the intent with these may have been noble, we believe that the occupation is no longer necessary to protect the territories. Indeed, the Ice States is now securely under the control of the CFA, which will not fall at any time soon. We would like to discuss and negotiate for the territories&#8217; return. The Macabean diplomats may now speak to offer their own perspective as to the matter here.&#8221; While externally, of course, he supported the occupation, internally he found that the occupation was a measure taken plainly in bad faith. If the true goal was to protect the territories, they would be promptly returned now, and the Golden Throne would have accepted the request that it seize occupying new territories. However, he could not speak these thoughts outwardly, lest he alienate the Golden Throne and make it more difficult for it to agree to return the territories.<br><br>The krierlord took a breath before responding. &#8220;I, and the Imperial Bureaucracy of the Golden Throne as a whole, certainly acknowledge the good faith showed by your government in not renewing defensive combat operations against our forces in the Green Zone. That is the primary reason that I, and my colleague Mr. Frogeder, are here today, willing to start what we hope is an ongoing open dialogue with the CFA government. It must be understood that our intention when declaring the Green Zone was to provide a safe space for all Icers to not only escape the war and live in peace, but also to find asylum from oppression and be able to conduct mutually advantageous exchange with the Golden Throne and the outside world. Growing trade flows between our two states has been a long-time objective since our imperial government first agreed to a defense pact with your now toppled imperial government, and it was under the auspices of that defense pact that we continue to defend the Icer right to free trade with the Golden Throne. At the moment, we remain unconvinced that this right would persist under the CFA regime and therefore hesitate to turn over the Green Zone to a government led by a political philosophy known&#8230;&#8221; &#8212; she chose her words carefully here &#8212; &#8220;to not necessarily uphold the same values. Guarantee that the Green Zone will continue to enjoy the same privileges it does currently vis-a-vis its commercial relationship with the Golden Throne, especially as it pertains cross-frontier trade and capital flows, must precede the withdrawal of imperial Macab&#233;an forces from Ormont.&#8221;<br><br>After hearing the Macabean representative out, and waiting for him to finish his speech, Saverchenko-Colleti now replied. &#8220;These interests are certainly reasonable, but we also find that continued military occupation is no longer necessary to achieve them. Indeed, the new economic system which have been establishing throughout the Ice States will make such that public and worker-owned businesses will be able to engage in capitalist trade with other nations, certainly including the Golden Throne. They will be allowed to sell trade products in other nations as they please, so long as all money used is provided to the government, which may in turn purchase products from other nations, such as the Golden Throne. We are certainly content to amend this system as it applies to the Golden Throne to further incentivise trade therewith, but overall we find that this fact renders the continued occupation no longer necessary to further Macabean trade interests.&#8221;<br><br>Surr stifled a laugh before she could show any hint of it on her face. This new regime was either entirely naive or it thought the Golden Throne novice enough to fall for that sort of rhetoric. Why would anyone conduct trade if they couldn&#8217;t pocket the gains? What kind of trade would be conducted in a world where it wasn&#8217;t guided by profit or loss? Communism was antithetical to a world of commerce and exchange unless the Communist regime made special provisions to eliminate the&#8230;Communism out of the system. History had plenty of examples in it to know the truth of that. She replied, &#8220;Mr.Savarchenko-Colleti, I don&#8217;t doubt the sincerity of your words. I must be equally sincere. That is not an arrangement to which the Golden Throne is amenable to because it&#8217;s an arrangement that will fall apart the second we withdraw from the Green Zone. Trade and commerce are antithetical to Communism. The only successful Communist states that benefit from trade and capital investment are those that allow for special economic zones, areas of their countries where the rules are more amenable to free trade and economic investment. Any future agreement regarding Macab&#233;an withdrawal from the Green Zone and its administrative cesion back to the Ice States would be under those conditions.&#8221;<br><br>The response	now came directly from Hazelbush, before Saverchenko-Colleti had a chance to begin to speak. &#8220;To be clear, we will not, under any circumstances, permit the open exploitation of the proletariat anywhere within the Ice States. The most we are willing to do &#8211; which we would only permit as our economic system is only being developed with the Empire&#8217;s fall &#8211; is permit businesses to keep any money gained from selling goods from the Ice States, only being permitted to use this money to purchase items from the Golden Throne and other nations. We hope that this is sufficient to protect Macabean economic interests, while not jeopardising the security of the proletariat from being oppressed under the capitalist economic system.&#8221;<br><br>Surr pursed her lips. Frogeder, who had so far remained silent in deference to the ranking representative of the empire, caught her displeasure. There was ambiguity in the Icer words. What did it mean to &#8216;jeopardise the security of the proletariat?&#8217; To what degree would &#8216;jeopardising the security of the proletariat&#8217; constrain trade flows? To both of the Macabeans, the Icers seemed to be pursuing double-speak. Surr was surely thinking that. Frogeder thought perhaps they were naive. He spoke up. &#8220;What could benefit the proletariat more than gains from trade, growing income from investment, and the wealth of economic dynamism?&#8221; the diplomat asked.<br><br>Once again, the reply came from Hazelbush, rather than Saverchenko-Colleti. The Macabeans were, by now, being obtuse to the needs and circumstances of the Ice States &#8211; and especially the circumstances resulting in the destruction of the Empire. &#8220;What could be worse than the bourgeois sending those who do not &#8211; or cannot &#8211; adequately work for them to the streets to starve? The implementation of a communist economy is a sine qua non for the proletariat to be free from such exploitation by the bourgeois, which necessarily occurs under any capitalist economic system or system of government. Your nation&#8217;s vision appears to be completely clouded by the greed which necessarily arises in a nation which so relentlessly pursues &#8216;economic freedom&#8217;, and there will come a time wherein the oppressed proletariat will take up arms against their capitalist oppressors.&#8221; The latest sentence on the part of Hazelbush by now doomed the negotiations, if they were not already doomed. Hazelbush knew this, and only spoke the sentence since the negotiations were already breaking down quickly. The General-President spoke over Saverchenko-Colleti in order to reinforce the authority of the statements; but this backfired, as Hazelbush clearly lacked the diplomatic tact and courtesy of Saverchenko-Colleti.<br><br>Frogeder eyed Surr, who looked unamused. He was about to respond but Surr answered first. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think continued conversation at this point will be productive. I mean that in the best way. Our long-term goal remains handing the territory back over to the legitimate government of the Ice States, as long as it meets the criteria we set forth when conducting the initial occupation. The&#8230;unique&#8230;requirements for an agreement will be passed on to His Imperial Majesty and the Kr&#237;erlord Kuncil. Perhaps soon we can meet again and continue this dialogue, maybe with a more concrete recommendation with how to move forward. For the time being, I request that you accept His Excellency Mr. Frogeder as the head of the Macab&#233;an diplomatic mission to your country. It would behoove both of our governments to maintain an open line of communication and Mr. Frogeder will act as the primary liaison to that effect. Acceptable?&#8221;<br><br>Now, Saverchenko-Colleti was the one to reply. &#8220;Acceptable. Once these criteria are provided to our nation, we will get back to your government with our response to these criteria, and whether we accept or deny. Indeed, it is of my belief that, regardless of the outcome of this meeting, we will be able to address this matter diplomatically without any Ice or Macabean blood having to be spilt.&#8221;</div>

It would arrive rather late, as Alexander had already been back in The Ice States for a few weeks now negotiating with The Golden Throne, but it was the principle of the matter. An investigation had been launched, and based on how events turned out between the PUF and TIS, it was determined that Alexander had indeed committed treasonous acts against TIS, and that returning Alexander would improve relations between the PUF and TIS, leading to a possible productive future between the two nations. <br><br>Of course, he had not committed any crimes against the PUF, so they had no reason to detain him. Instead he was given a Foreign Ministry escort back to a city of his choosing, once the civil war in TIS was resolved. <br><br><hr><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">OLDWITCH, THE COMMUNAL UNION OF THE ICE STATES</span><br><br>As negotiations between the Communal Union and the Golden Throne dragged on, the PUF continued to reinforce and rebuild their occupied territories. Officially, it was to maintain the security of the occupied territories and provide aid to the new Communal Union, as an act of goodwill between the Union and the Federation. Unofficially, it was to meet the same objectives as TGT when they occupied the Green Zone, in the event the Communal Union fell, in this case to TGT invasion, they could fall back to a PUF controlled zone and regroup and rebuild. It wouldn't be much, but it would prevent the whole nation from falling. Rapid reaction forces were being positioned to blitz to Wintercourt, so they could claim it under PUF protection, and ideally surrender the province to the PUF if negotiations went south. <br><br>Nicaro and Firmador had already fallen to The Golden Throne, the ethnic cousins of Mokans under colonial rule. Keeping The Ice States free was less about their own sovereignty, and more about limiting Golden influence this close to Federal Borders. Not that relations between the PUF and TGT were strained, they were good trade partners after all, but rather the ideological differences between a Monarchist Empire and a former colony who freed itself with bullet and bayonet. Keeping the balance of power was important. <br><br>Therefore, the PUF welcomed the new Communal Union to send its Officers to interview and process the some 50 or 60 thousand POWs captured during the war, and determine which could be reintegrated into the new Army of The Communal Union. Offers for military aid would come soon as well, as no doubt the small nation would need to rebuild its army, and the Communal Union would need friends, and trade partners.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City, The Ice States.</span><br><br>The Ice judicial bureaucrats reviewed paper after paper. Some of them held evidence against the detainees, others described the acts they had committed... and it was certainly sufficient to build a criminal case, such that all the defendants could be tried en masse. However, the main problem now was the fact that there were no laws against these acts when they were committed. The Ice imperial government allowed the Ice military to engage in whatever acts were necessary to advance military goals, regardless of ethics or morality. This meant that any prosecution had to rely on ex post facto laws against the accused.<br><br>In addition, while the trial would be adjudicated by the nation of the Ice States if necessary, it would be preferible at least for an ostensibly impartial tribunal, such as from a neutral nation, to adjudicate the trial. This increased the propaganda and reputational benefit of convicting high-ranking Imperial Icers for crimes against humanity. Of course, it would remain the Communal Union which would prosecute the trial. A secured transmission was sent to the judicial departments of four other nations in Greater Dienstad, which were believe to be the ideal adjudicators of the trial and were all neutral in the conflict; <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Agar-Na">Agar-Na</a>, <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Tangatarehua">Tangatarehua</a>, <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Ahsca">Ahsca</a>, and <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Czaslyudian%20Peoples">Czaslyudian Peoples</a>.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">From: Courtney Hazelbush of the Ice States<br>To: Government of [recipient nation]<br><br>To whom it may concern,<br><br>As you likely already know, the government of the Empire of the Ice States, guided by the fictional deity Klyprer and his supposed teachings, has been overthrown in a long-delayed worker's revolution, performed by the Communist Freedom Army. This has resulted in the formation of the Communal Union of the Ice States, and the arrest of various high-ranking Ice figures.<br><br>Over the next weeks, we intend to commence a trial of these figures for various crimes against humanity, based on ex post facto laws against these offences. While we will be prosecuting these figures, we would like, in order to ensure impartiality, that foreign nations from around Greater Dienstad be the ones to adjudicate the trial. We therefore ask if the nation of [recipient nation] would be willing to supply justices to adjudicate the trials.<br><br>The trial will occur at Southport City, the capital of the Communal Union, but we are willing to meet at the embassy in [recipient nation] to discuss this.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Courtney Hazelbush,<br>Temporary General-President,<br>The Communal Union of the Ice States.</span></blockquote><br>The list of offenders and offences was attached to the transmission. They ranged from, of course, Emperor Sotolo II himself, to high-ranking military leaders such as Colonel Tibett and General Burkes, to many others of varying complicity in the offences. The Duke of Wintercourt himself, and some of his aides, were likewise to be prosecuted for the BLACKSEAT virus, which represented an either reckless or malicious attack on the civilian population of Nicaro.<br><br>The first and foremost offence for which the Icers would be tried would be the persecution of Czaslyudians in Operation Diamond Dog. For the genocide, the event which started this whole civil war, all identified individuals who were complicit in the leadership or organisation of the genocide would be tried and hopefully convicted. Defendants would also be tried various war crimes committed by the Ice imperial forces throughout the war; namely, the bombing of Stonegrad and attempted bombing of Cruxhampton, as well as the attacks on civilian populations in Ixana and Nicaro abroad. Indeed, it had been decided that those responsible for war crimes in Ixana and Nicaro would, if found guilty, be extradited to Holy Marsh and the Golden Throne respectively to be penalised there.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 95%; line-height: 116%;">Raiepe Ariki Taneti stared intently at the pages of the Maori to English dictionary open in front of him, his eyes carefully scanning down the many rows and columns until he found the definition he was looking for:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Tohunga</span> (noun) a skilled person, chosen expert, priest, healer - a person chosen by the agent of an atua and the tribe as a leader in a particular field because of signs indicating talent for a particular vocation. </span><br><br>He snapped the tome closed. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic">Tohunga</span>. Not an easy word to translate into English. Sometimes the word was translated as 'priest' and that was, in Taneti's case, technically correct. After all he was a high ranking servant of the Department of the Spiritual and by convention had been inducted into the priesthood when he first became a Judge all those years ago. <br><br>'Expert' was a better translation, he thought. He was after all nothing if not a scholar and one of the most learned men in all of Tangatarehua at that. A polyglot, fluent in at least five languages, a justice of Tangatarehua's supreme court and a sought after advisor to both the Most Honourable Rangatira and Her Sacred Majesty the Empress. <br><br>The reality though is that he was, plain and simple, a Judge - just a jumped up former lawyer who through a lifetime of effort had come to be recognised as one of the nation's foremost authorities on all legal matters. <br><br>He looked up at the crack of bright sunlight that crept in through a window obscured by stacks of books, floor to ceiling, and found himself startled to see the figure of a young messenger reflected in the glass, standing behind him.<br><br>He turned, clutching his chest slightly - at his age, sudden shocks like this weren't exactly helpful for his heart. <br><br>"Can I help you?" he asked the young stranger.<br><br>"Are you Tohunga Raiepe Ariki Taneti of the Supreme Court of Tangatarehua?" the young man asked. <br><br>Taneti nodded and the young man approached him with a sealed envelope, bearing the insignia of the Department of State. <br><br>"The Most Honourable Rangatira requests an audience with you at your nearest convenience," said the messenger. "He has asked that you meet him urgently and that if possible you could fly to Tamaki this afternoon?"<br><br>Taneti wheezed a little. He was supposed to be taking it easy, on doctor's orders, in fact he'd lately been contemplating retirement. Yet the envelope in his hand and the appearance of this messenger portended no such rest. In the end, his sense of duty prevailed and he told the young man that he would catch the first flight north to Tamaki and arrange to meet the Rangatira this afternoon. <br><br>The messenger bowed and left and Taneti grabbed his walking stick and told his secretary and chauffeur that he was urgently required in Tamaki and to put all other matters on hold for the time being.<br><br><hr> <br><br>Two hours later, he arrived at the Rangatirapa, also known as the Palace of the Rangatira. The flight took less than an hour, with his biggest struggle being the traffic in Tamaki once he'd landed. <br><br>He was recognised immediately upon arrival and escorted straight into the palace where he was greeted by Rangatira Te Rata Te Rongomau - a giant man, over seven feet tall, muscular, tattooed and yet somehow also frail.<br><br>"Tena Koe, Most Honourable Rangatira," he said with a bow, before the Rangatira pressed his nose and forehead against Taneti's to greet him with a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongi" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">hongi</a>. <br><br>"I am grateful that you have agreed to meet with me, especially under such short notice," said the Rangatira, gesturing to an arm chair in his office. "Please be seated."<br><br>Both men crouched down into their seats with a certain level of difficulty - for Taneti, it was his age, his spine and his worsening arthritis. For Te Rongomau, the difficulty was simply due to his size - even the largest of chairs tended to be too small for a man of his physical stature. <br><br>"To what do I owe this tremendous honour?" Tineti asked. <br><br>Behind the Rangatira, from an adjoining office room, emerged another recognisable national figure - a younger, smartly dressed man who greeted Tineti with a smile.<br><br>"It is an honour to meet you, great Tohunga," said Tipene Kahurangi Patariki, the Secretary of the Exterior. "Let me also introduce you to His Excellency Tamati Petera, our Ambassador to the Ice States."<br><br>A third man emerged and greeted him with a curt bow. <br><br>"Are you familiar with the situation in the Ice States?" asked the Rangatira.<br><br>Tineti shook his head. <br><br>"Apart from a few news reports in foreign media outlets, no I'm not intimately familiar with the situation."<br><br>The Secretary of the Exterior chuckled. "Don't worry. Very soon you will be. In fact you'll soon know more than any of us."<br><br>"I take it then that, given your lack of knowledge, you could also safely be assumed to carry no bias?" continued the Rangatira. <br><br>Immediately, Tineti figured out what was happening. These were the kinds of questions that lawyers asked to potential jurors, to ensure that they would not prejudice a trial.<br><br>"I can confirm that I am not biased by any ideology or vested interests in the affairs of a foreign nation or its ongoing civil war," he said.<br><br>"Such as we'd hoped," said the Rangatira, pulling out a piece of paper and handing it to Tineti. "The Imperial government was honoured to receive this request, via our embassy in the Ice States, from an individual called Courtney Hazelbush."<br><br>Tineti paused to peruse Hazelbush's letter inviting Tangatarehua to send a justice to Southport City where a trial was to take place to determine whether former members of the imperial government were guilty of crimes against humanity. <br><br>"So..." said Tineti slowly, his eyes drawing immediately to Tamati Petera. "A revolution they say?"<br><br>"My understanding is that the Communist Freedom Army have gained almost complete control of the Ice States now," said the Ambassador. "I can't know this for certain as I was evacuated from Magecastle last week as a precaution during the fighting. What I <span style="font-style: italic">can </span>tell you is that the Ice States have not been a particularly pleasant place to be as of late."<br><br>"With a name like 'Ice States', I can't imagine it being a pleasant place to be at any time of year," Tineti quipped, slightly under his breath. "Sounds like the kind of place that would make Motumakariri look tropical."<br><br>"When I received this request," said the Rangatira, "I knew that there was only person in our empire who would be sufficient for such a task. Who possessed the knowledge, the character, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Mana</a>and the honour to represent our nation in such a momentous task."<br><br>"Oh? Was he busy?" Tineti quipped again, this time drawing a small guffaw from Tipene. "No, I of course am willing to do all that Her Sacred Majesty's government requires of me and if that involves travelling to the other side of Greater Dienstad to preside over a war crimes trial then I pledge to execute that to the best of my abilities."<br><br>The Rangatira smiled. "I know you will."<br><br>"I do have some questions though."<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Tineti looked down at the paper and visibly baulked a little at the words '<span style="font-style: italic">Worker's Revolution'</span>.<br><br>"This does seem to represent a change in foreign policy, does it not?" he said. "The imperial government has not traditionally aided or even recognised communist governments previously. I mean for one thing we are one of the only countries that still refuses to recognise the People's Republic of China as a legitimate state!<br><br>"Why then would we accept a request from communist revolutionaries to try a regime who, distasteful as they may have been, were nevertheless one with whom we had a stable working relationship. This just feels like it could be a trap, a ploy by communists to gain international legitimacy to an otherwise -"<br><br>"I shall have to stop you there, Tohunga," said the Rangatira holding up his enormous hand. "This has nothing to do with diplomatic recognition or even ideology. This is about determining the facts and I would assume you of all people would put fact-finding ahead of any other consideration in this matter.<br><br>"The truth is that it may well come down to what you report when we make the decision as to whether or not to formally recognise the so-called Communal Union. <br><br>"It may be that you judge these people to be the very revolutionary heroes they claim to be, in which case we ought celebrate the overthrow of a slaver regime who abused human rights. We may not agree with communism, but one is always innocent until proven guilty and that applies even to communists.<br><br>"Of course it might also transpire that this is a show trial and that the legitimate government of the Ice States are innocent of all charges, in which case Tangatarehua would offer asylum to the leaders of the old regime and safe passage.<br><br>"What matters most however is determining the facts and I am pleased that the new leadership has sought advice from neutral countries such as ours. In fact it's a good portent that perhaps the new regime may in fact be benevolent in character."<br><br>Tineti nodded. "I see."<br><br>"You are not being sent as a diplomat. You are a man of the law and that is all we ask - that you preside over a fair trial, based on the rule of law, nothing more and nothing less."<br><br>"I can of course do that," Tineti said. <br><br>"This is a great honour for our nation," said the Rangatira. "Not more than 50 years ago foreign judges came to our isles to determine if the leaders of our former regime were guilty of war crimes. We benefitted from a free and fair trial - I myself was put on trial as I'm sure you know and I was fairly acquitted. I ask then that you extend that same fairness to those in the Ice States.<br><br>"And perhaps of course this is a sign that at last we have found atonement for our nation's past sins."<br><br>There was a moment of silence. <br><br>"When do I leave?" Asked Tineti. <br><br>"Whenever you're ready. It's going to be a long flight - 17 hours I believe, and it's going to be cold there too. But you'll be meeting other justices from other nations and so I ask you to represent our nation well and ensure that our reputation is nothing short of excellent among the others with whom you work."<br><br>Tineti bowed deeply. "I won't let you down, Most Honourable Rangatira."<br><br>"Well then," the Rangatira presented him with a tray and two small shot glasses, filled with <span style="font-style: italic">Waipiro Kumara</span> or Sweet Potato Vodka, the traditional drink of Tangatarehua. "Let us drink to your health and success."<br><br>The two men clinked their glasses and downed their shots before Raiepe Ariki Taneti left to pack for the long flight to Southport City.</span></div>

This land was far different than his mother country. What had been the familiar bustle of downtown Sevyich encompassed by the stretch of enchanting stretches of yellow grass sticking through powdery snow was now replaced by an alien environment. Foreign architecture shot out of the ground like jagged shards and a cacophony of urban noise pumped through the city like rushing water. War engulfed this country, but to his view it had already been restored to its regular rhythms. <br><br>And to think that Czaslyudian soldiers many months ago had overlooked this very city. <br><br>Pavel Ilyin shook himself out of his thoughts, and proceeded across the airport. He had on a worn, patched coat that wrapped relaxedly around his frame, and kept his simple tan suit, which had seen better days, safe from the elements. Ilyin himself was an antsy figure, his eyes set on some unseen thing while his lips pursed and relaxed constantly, ending a conversation that had not yet started. His bald head, crowned by greying black hair, was mostly covered by a semi-formal felt hat. <br><br>Pavel briefly removed this hat for security, slipped off his beaten loafers, and submitted his leather briefcase as diplomatic cargo. He felt the security officers&#8217; eyes discern him suspiciously&#8211; a Czaslyudian incomer must have seemed unusual, considering the circumstances&#8211; but years as a clergyman steeled him against those kinds of gazes. <br><br>Things were simpler then. It was a remarkably straightforward life; give sermons to the dwindling adherents of the Jewish faith in Czaslyudiya, and watch as the government at the time, in its unspoken animosity towards organized religion to anything but itself, clamped down on his institution. The foreign backers to their synagogue were dwindling, too, but Pavel found it easier, in a way, that it all came to an end. Instead of fighting a losing war, he acquainted himself with the law, if it could be called that, and tried a different approach to the war he fought. It eventually ended&#8211; but though the old Federal Republic had lost, Pavel had a difficult time finding where exactly he had won. He was in the room as the second government was reforged into the current one--one of some four hundred--and was of course lauded after the fact for his ongoing contributions to his community and to Czaslyudiya as a whole. But he knew those communities were unchanged; and privately doubted anything would change with the rest of the country. <br><br>Now Pavel was handed a daunting task. Not only to represent what his peers, but mostly his superiors, thought he was good for, but to take a part in fixing a problem he had no bearing in creating. The problems were these: a Czaslyudian judge presiding over the tribunals of those who committed ethnically-motivated, targeted killings against that same group brought up the matter of bias on a massive scale; a Czaslyudian judge, with political experience, presiding over the tribunals of foreign nationals who had taken part in waging a war against the judge&#8217;s homeland brought up another particular issue of bias; and finally, a Czaslyudian judge presiding over tribunals that were swiftly put in place by the victors of a civil war, particularly a communist one, with severe foreign pressures to convict all involved. The first two were something Pavel could not avoid&#8211; the FRCP demanded representation, so here he was. It would mean the end of his career if he turned it down, beginning and ending with disbarment. The last one was just something that was out of his hands. Like so many other things in his life had been.<br><br>But innocents were dead&#8211; regardless of his mother country&#8217;s motivations, Ilyin would do them the courtesy of ensuring that justice was properly dealt out. He would have to make sure his judgements were in accordance with those throughout his career&#8211; not simply to do harm to enemies and good to friends, but to give each what is owed, unswayed by sentiment or bias: the ultimate ideal of a magistrate.<br><br>Ilyin carried himself a little higher. Reaching those at the edge of the airport he was supposed to meet, he set out to his work in the belly of the beast.</div>

Of course the UIS was aware of the conflict in The Ice States, I mean it had large ripple effects through all the region and Several of AHSCA's own allies were all involved in some capacity, Holy Marsh and Mokastana directly to that. AHSCA of course cannot wage any war without being directly attacked first so it was neutral in the matter with the most posturing being limited to a few passive condemnations, a beefing of security at embassies and travel warnings but that was about it. So why now, were they being asked to help adjudicate the post-war matters of justice? Frankly, it was any one's guess as to why, the UIS is a very minor player in regional politics, much less in the world. Did someone put in a good word for them? Well it's possible perhaps but well here they were.<br><br>In the morning hours, the Duchess was preparing to make her choice of who to send as AHSCA's presiding justice in the matter, she had just the person in mind. The door opened as Marcella's handmaiden walked in with another woman at her side. "My Lady, Justice Kobayashi here for you."<br><br>"Thank you. Please won't you sit down?"<br><br>"Of course, Your Grace." Justice Yuzumi Kobayashi, often she went by Yuzu with her close friends or colleagues, a member of AHSCA's young judicial system since 2017 and been Chief Justice since 2020. Right now though why she was meeting with the Duchess was something of a mystery to her, she was starting to wonder if she was about to be dismissed but well no need to jump to conclusions. <br><br>"Allow me to get to the point, Justice Kobayashi, I have a request for you. A war tribunal is being organized in The Ice States right now, I'll spare you the current events report, you can read up on that later, but they've asked us to be apart of the proceedings and that means sending a judge of our own. I feel you are a highly qualified candidate for the job, if you'd like to accept?"<br><br>Yuzumi was a bit flabbergasted by this sudden dump of information but she had good reason to want to serve in a war crimes tribunal with her own family history, both her parents fought for AHSCA's independence, an uncle of hers was a POW who was tortured and in the inverse, an aunt of hers actually captured POWs. "My lady, It would be a great honor to serve. But I'm also just a bit surprised we'd be asked."<br><br>"I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling the same sense of surprise and a bit of confusion, but here we are. If you are accepting, I'll have Noire prepare everything for you and get you set up. You'll be going to The Ice States for this and you'll be serving with a few others from other nations."<br><br>"My Lady, thank you for this opportunity, I will do my best."<br><br>And that is how we are here today, <span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City</span>. Since meeting and accepting the position as a "international justice" (granted that's probably not an actual title), Yuzumi had to spend a lot of time reading, reading the matters of the case before her, matters of law between the nations also adjudicating this case, profiles of the other judges as well, laws of the Ice States, military law. It was a lot, it was like cramming a few years of law school in a few short days. She was told not to sweat all the little details, frankly there were a fair few cynics who were telling her this was really a show trial, that this was decided already. Officer VinoCacao really shrugged and said "maybe, maybe not" Well, she had to still do her best to see this would be just. Just as it was back home with her panel of judges, so it would be here. Of course one cannot arrive to such an important event by sea, so she was given a chartered flight to Southport City, good thing, a voyage could take weeks or months even! Admittedly, it was her first time flying but she better keep that to herself for now. AHSCA was already known to be rather Luddite-light and well admittedly their judicial system was surprisingly new, but their nation was still technically new as it was. Well point is, she wanted to be considered a respectable judicial advocate for the position, not an ignorant hick.<br><br>Well now she was here, true to the name The Ice States was cold, well colder than her tropical home for sure, but kind of pretty in the scenery. It was hard to imagine there was so much bloodshed and death not too long ago, well now she was here to see those who were responsible would be, and presumably those who were unwilling participants or innocent victims would be weeded out and protected. AHSCA not to long ago was in this very situation, but to create a tenuous peace and to see the security of independence, those ultimately responsible would never have to face justice in this life, she now was here to see that that history wouldn't have to be repeated here.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Invitation to the Tribunal</span><br>Jonas was in his second floor office that afternoon, gazing out absentmindedly at the lawn on Courthouse Square. There was a lull in his docket that afternoon, and he had become distracted from reviewing the progress of cases from earlier that week. A pudgy, slightly balding judge of the Nitra Superior Ducal Court for seven years liked his job. He like his office a bit less, drafty, outdated, and completely typical for an Agarese provincial court. Sighing, he turned his attention to the claim of alleged lease violation brought by a warehouse owner in Neslusa against his tenant, a clothing retailer that had fallen on hard times. Such was a typical workload for Jonas Dobrovodsky. He usually got civil cases. There wasn&#8217;t much crime in the Duchy of Nitra, and most of that was involved with theft and public nuisance. Life was pretty placid in Dolne Yadikov, and throughout the Duchy. Largely rural, away from the coast and north of the main highway from Agar leading eastward, the Duchy had been spared the destruction of the Ralkovian War in the recentr past, as the Eitoan Army pushed the Ralkovian forces out of the Principality. That afternoon his thoughts were on home, and his two sons now away in college. The boys were doing well, the oldest studying accounting in Agar, the youngest hoping to follow his dad&#8217;s footsteps into law at the University of Bratislava. Although his job wasn&#8217;t dramatic, he found it satisfying. Moving up the ranks at the Nitra Superior Court allowed him more leeway in selecting his cases. And he was chummy with his colleagues, both on the bench and among the Dolny Yadikov bar. Of late he had been called in several times at the request of Duke Slany to review provisions of large property acquisitions by foreign investors, the Duke being concerned for the impacts on the rights of local landowners and the value of their property.<br><br>A red and green colored envelope caught his eye at the corner of his busy desk. Court documents in Agar-Na still required transmission of a physical copy, but most of these still used the traditional gray envelope. He opened the letter.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">From The Embassy of The Communal Union of the Ice States</span><br>Greetings Honored Jurist<br><br>Per the attached correspondence between our two governments, I would be honored for you to join me at our embassy in Agar to discuss this matter of great importance to my nation.<br><br>With greatest respect,<br><br>Dexter Watts<br>Second Secretary<br>Embassy of The Communal Union of the Ice States to The Principality of Agar-Na.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">From: Courtney Hazelbush of the Ice States<br>To: Government of Agar-Na<br><br>To whom it may concern,<br><br>As you likely already know, the government of the Empire of the Ice States, guided by the fictional deity Klypher and his supposed teachings, has been overthrown in a long-delayed worker's revolution, performed by the Communist Freedom Army.

Pending his agreement to your offer and with the approval of Duke Slany of Nitra we will approve of his service on these proceedings, in the interests of justice.</blockquote><br><br></div></blockquote><br><br>Jonas was startled. He didn&#8217;t know what to make of it. He turned to his tablet, and searched on Ice States. The first results pulled up information about Icecliff, far to the south on the continent. He finally found the official site of The Communal Union of the Ice States. This was pretty grim stuff. He was vaguely aware of the Civil War there, and the preceding controversies that spun around that country before it&#8217;s emperor was overthrown in the wake of big power invasions. Of course, like most Agarese, Jonas was horrified as news of Operation Diamond Dog leaked out, sympathetic to the plight of the Czaslyudians under that murdueous plan. But on a day to day basis, all of this had very little to do with him. He was very unfamiliar with the country in general, so he began to do a little more research. Apparently the previous regime was very harsh and bigoted, a theocracy rigidly enforced. But now it appeared to be run by a communist government, and he had very little sympathy for communists. He read further. He found Mokan, Macabbean and Marshite accounts of the actions of the Emperor that precipitated his overthrow and subsequent installation of the communists. Very little of what he read made sense to him. What was the Emperor thinking, alienating bigger, stronger neighbors? And what were the aims of the current regime? Had they vacated all previous laws installed under the emperor? He could find no civil or criminal code for The Ice States that was current. Under what rules would the Tribunal operate? And why were they reaching out to him? <br><br>Time went by. An hour and a half later, he was just as confused as when he opened the envelope. He grabbed the embassy dispatch, straightened his tie, and threw on his jacket. At the end of the hallway, he walked down a flight of stairs, and knocked on the door of the court&#8217;s presiding judge. There was a brief discussion. The presiding judge was just as surprised as Jonas. &#8220;Did you know about this? Was there any notificaion? Any word from Agar or from the Duke?&#8221; he asked. The presiding judge flushed red. At least he was due a notification, out of courtesy, and he put in a call to Duke Slany. Slany was summonsed to the conference, and the three discussed Dobrovodsky&#8217;s offer together. Although Slany was also chagrined by the embassy&#8217;s inconsiderate communication, he felt it best to allow the judge to go ahead and evaluate the offer. The Duke would bring the matter up with Foreign Minister Count Abravanel at the next meeting of the Royal Council.<br><br>At home that night, Jonas was distracted by the matter all throughout dinner. His wife Zuska coaxed it out of him before dessert. His precocious daughter, Hedviga was curious. She had a million questions about The Ice States? Would she be going? She didn&#8217;t want to miss her friends, but this sounded like an adventure. Zuska wasn&#8217;t big on the idea. Neither was Jonas. But this was a matter of some importance, and they discussed it throughout the evening.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Dobrovodsky&#8217;s Questions</span><br><br>Judge Dobrovodsky and his wife mulled over the invitation for the rest of the week. Travel was a concern. Would the three of them be going? If not, now often could he visit home? Was travel safe? Was Southport City safe? How much would this cost, and who would pay for it? Did Agar-Na even have diplomatic representation in Southport City? Where would they stay, and was the country primitive? There were so many questions! And this was so removed from their relatively bucolic life. His family concerns were foremost. Hedviga was doing well, a cute, spirited 14 year old, popular at school. He and Zuska weren't kean on interrupting that. So after further discussion, it seemed he&#8217;d be heading to Southport City solo, if at all. His thoughts alone also turned the the postwar docket. Nitra Duchy had dodged the brunt of the fighting during the Ralkovian War, so he saw very few cases related to the conflict. But it wasn&#8217;t immune to tensions that arose in The Principality in the wake of the war. Fear spread throught the ethnic Eitoan community in The Principality, and as an ethnic Eitoan Jonas felt that. He made contingency plans with ethnic Agarese neighbors in the event the Death Guard cam looking for the family as Ralkovian forces advanced eastward. When the Eitoan Army expelled the Ralkovian forces, it was the turn of his ethnic Ralkovian neighbors to feel unease. Fortunately, war had bypassed the Duchy, and the only cases he saw were a few instances of ethnic harrassment, mostly inconsequential.<br><br>By Friday, he had decided to visit the embassy in Agar. Agar was OK. He&#8217;d been there many times, as a law student, in private practice and on the bench. He had his favorite places, mostly in the southeastern suburbs. The big question was how to get there. Flying from Dolne Yadikov to Agar International seemed impractical. The flight was turbulent and the planes were usually outdated and dirty. He&#8217;d drive, or take the train in. Jonas wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the idea or a road trip. Highway repair in the outlying duchies was sketchy, and traffic was prone to delays. The car needed service. And a six years old he didn&#8217;t want to risk a breakdown on he road. Then too was the issue of getting around in the city. Stowing the car was another hassle. That would be an additional expense. Staying in the suburbs would be cheaper, but there would still be parking at the embassy, as far as he knew. He wasn&#8217;t familiar with the diplomatic qusrter. So the following Tuesday Zuska dropped him off bright and early at the Dolne Yadikov station, with Hedviga in tow. It had been a while since he&#8217;d taken the train. Agarese Railways coaches were usually pleasant, and almost always on time. This trip was no different, crossing the countryside, stopping at Lodno and Povina briefly. The route was calming, traversing several stretches of forest, and mostly passing by well tended fields and orchards. Early in the trip Jonas nursed a cup of coffee, and dug into some of the sparse material he could glean about the Ice States legal system. At 3:30 PM the train pulled in to Agar Central Rail Depot, bustling with activity. Most passengers were travelling on business, with lesiure travel more likely on weekends. He passed a number of platforms along concourse D, with rumpled travelers from the eastern duchies, bedraggled Czaslyudians and Eitoan businessmen joining him along the way to the main terminal. On his way through he paused to buy a snack, a dark chocolate and nougat candy bar, boosting his energy before the embassy meeting. He hailed a ride outside the depot, and was off to the embassy. Along the way he passed the Prime Minister&#8217;s office, and the monument to Prince Harold I. Both imposing edifices, the car sped along Bodovice Street, dodging other vehicles. He could never drive in such a mess! At the intersection of Radav Avenue they stood in traffic for 10 minutes, the driver honking wildly and swearing profusely in Ralkovian. Finally a squadron of traffic police cleared the intersection, directing the flow around a grisly looking crash involving a bus and a delivery truck. In fifteen minutes they arrived at the gates of the embassy. After clearing security, he was greeted by a tired looking attendant and ushered into the embassy proper. Jonas was unimpressed with the premises. Along the way he gaped at the embsssies of the bigger states, Eitoan, The Golden Throne, The Ordenite Reich. The Ice States were housed in a more modest three story building with a small courtyard. It could have easily been the home of a prosperous businessman in Dolne Yadikov, not out of place in his neighborhood. Once inside a thin, gray haired man, seemingly nervous introduced himself as Dexter Watts. He carried a briefcase, and ushered Jonas in to a well appointed anteroom on the first floor. <br><br>&#8220;I trust you&#8217;ve had a pleasant trip, Judge Dobrovodsky&#8221;, he started. May I get you some refreshments&#8221;?<br><br>&#8220;Yes, please. A cola, perhaps. No ice&#8221; Jonas answered.<br><br>Watts ordered up two colas. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re wondering why The Communal Union has asked you to join our tribunal. While it is true that our countries haven&#8217;t had much in terms of relations in the past, we believe it is important that this court get off on the right foot, as seen by accepted international standards. Of course, the laws of the previous regime run counter to those standards. So the government of The Communal Union is reaching out to those who serve under more generally recognized legal canon. And in terms of the Icer public, it is important that they see the tribunal&#8217;s decisions as rendered by impartial judges, not influenced by the bigger powers.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I see&#8221;, said Jonas.<br><br>Pointing to two red bound volumes, Watts continued. &#8220;Here you&#8217;ll find the Writ of Law of the Empire of the Ice States. Dismal, to be certain, but instructive as to how courts operated historically in The Ice States. The People&#8217;s Tribunals are still working on a Manifesto of Justice to replace it. Of course we will be replacing reactionary holdouts in the courts over time, but for now this is the context under which the attorneys for the defense and prosecution will conduct the trials. This tribunal will operate on an ex post facto basis, however. The scope of atrocities is too horrible and existing Ice States law too corrupt and narrow to allow it to operate otherwise. Please feel free to peruse the sections pertaining to rules of evidence, indictment, and the basis for conviction in capital cases.&#8221;<br><br>Jonas stared at the volumes. &#8220;Thank you. I will. Now, this sounds like a major undertaking. What kind of compensation are you offering? And what can I expect in terms of lodging and security? Will you cover lodging, travel, and meal costs for my family while I am sitting at court in Southport City?&#8221;<br><br>Watts looked sheepishly at the judge. &#8220;We will cover all travel to and from Southport City for the tribunal. Housing will be provided at Willshire Palace, appropriated for the purpose of the tribunal, heavily guarded and sequestered from the public and media. The Communal Union has arranged with Count Abravanel to continue your salary during your absence from The Principality, and will match it on a one for one basis during your service. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Decision to Attend</span><br><br>Judge Dobrovodsky pondered the offer all weekend. Sequestered in his study at home, only taking brief meals, he weighed the strain of a long absence from his family and cases on the docket against the need for justice in a land unfamiliar with it, a lofty task that he had never imagined facing. There were many unknowns. Would the Ice State authorities uphold verdicts? Would the court pronounce sentence? Who would serve on the tribunal with him, and under what legal system was there experience? Is there a presumption of guilt, or of innocence? Sunday afternoon he decided that it would be best to serve on the tribunal. For what it was worth, under murky conditions he would serve justice as best he could. <br><br>He hadn&#8217;t done much foreign travel. Of course he&#8217;d made a few trips to Ralkovia before the war, and to Eitoan before and after the war. His younger son was attracted to potential internships at Eitoan firms, the better to gain clients when he passed the bar. And of course there were a few vacations in the south of the continent when he was younger. After taking a break, a short walk through the neighborhood, he started scoping out flights to Southport City. Unsurprisingly, there were no direct flights, not from Agar-Na, not from Eitoan. There would have to be a connecting flight. And what he found showed most would have at least two connections. Resigned to a tedious journey, he found few options in Agar-Na. Most were regional connectors out of Agar International. There was a weekly out of Margeany to Aman, and from there there were several options through to Gente Del Agua. But the destination airport in Gente was far to the north of The Ice States, and he didn&#8217;t relish another long layover or drive in an unfamiliar land. But there were many daily flights from Agar International to Eitoan, and from there frequent service to Motokata and Holy Marsh. Service from Eitoan, from Kelso, Vladarsik or Berwyn showed no direct flights to Southport City. The prices on Mokan Airlines were attractive, some with only one layover at Kelso International, and seemed reasonably priced. Jonas briefly perused options through Czaslyudia. The choices there were poor. There were plenty of options from Dolne Yadikov across the border, but no good options onward from there. There Would have to be continuing service to Sevyich or Korf. And from there to Southport City was almost impossible. And he was sure the Czaslyudians would be suspicious of any traveler carrying an Ice States visa. Contact through Czaslyudia could be a target of old regime holdouts at Southport City to cite judicial bias, so this option was a non starter. He decided on a flight from Agar International to Motokata City through Kelso, and from Motokata by train, meeting with Icer officials at the border for escort to Southport City.<br><br>The following Saturday found Dobrovodsky packing up bright and early for his afternoon train to the capital. A carry on for incidentals, including his medicines and a couple changes of clothes were packed first. He chose to forward air freight two judicial robes and a week&#8217;s clothing change along, including two of his favorite suits, one blue pinstripe, the other light gray chalkstripe. Another valise to go air freight contained a few of his favored books on international legal doctrine and the theory of war crime prosecution. Included was the seminal &#8220;International Criminal Law Cases toiletries, and two bottles of his favorite Ammanite Chardonay. He rummaged through his study and bedroom, and carefully reviewed his travel documents; his passport, visas for Eitoan and the PUF, and special diplomatic passport issued by The Ice States. Although Eitoan didn&#8217;t require a visa for Agarese, he was in the habit of travelling with one. At 1 PM he set off, his wife dropping him off at the train station. The express to Agar arrived promptly, and he took his seat in a forward coach. At this time of day the train was about half full, mostly with businessmen and students. The ride was smooth, and at Agar he ordered up ground transportation to Agar International. <br><br>The van pulled into the Departure ramp, passengers shouting out the name of their airline. Four others also shouted &#8220;Mokan!&#8221;. Others were headed on continent, or to Macabea proper. After clearing security before entering the terminal, he found the Mokan Airlines counter and validated his ticket. The attendant, a perky redhead checked in his bag, and he headed down Concourse 3, where his fellow travelers were chattering away. After a delay of twenty minutes, the cheerful stewardess welcomed her passengers to Mokan Flight 327. The plane loaded, idled for about ten minutes, and then was airborne, climbing gently above the Agar industrial parks until reaching cruising altitude. He had a window seat, nobody sitting next to him. As Flight 327 climbed to clear the foothills of the Tatras, he could make out the town of Nepo, much contested during the Battle of Bartenura. He dozed off as it passed into Eitoan air space, past Lv&#8217;aad, descending on the flight path following the Malawani, then circling the airport and landing at Kelso.<br><br>As the plane taxied, Janos nudged awake, straightened his hair and tie, and stretched his legs. He yawned, and looked out the window. Busy place. He&#8217;d only flown into Kelso twice before. A very busy place, but at least they spoke Dienstadi. As the plane disembarked, he thanked the stewardesses and shuffled in line for security check. The agents from Eitoan Border Control were polite, but serious.He was a little self conscious about any Agarese accent. Looking around the concourse, he found the gate for Mokan 63, which would take him to to Motokata. Along the way he found a bar, pretty quiet for a major airport this time of day, and ordered up a dry martini. Perusing the menu, he settled on some lamb sausages and barley. He had about an hour to kill, and he split the time between browsing the Eitoan One News site, and a copy of The Eitoan News Herald. <br><br>Flight 63 to Motokata City Raimundo Sollano Airport went smoothly, and his passengers were pretty upscale. On this leg he felt self conscious also, most of the other passengers dressed casually and chatting away in Mokan. He was in suit and tie, appropriate for a Superior Court judge, and he wasn&#8217;t familiar with the language. He chatted a bit with a heavyset lady across the aisle, clearly well heeled, her Dienstadi being passable.Dinner was served, some kind of fish with which he wasn&#8217;t familiar, which was surprisingly sweet. Again he snoozed. It was nighttime when they touched down in Raimundo Sollano. At arrival he was ushered into customs, and pointed to the &#8220;Visa Required&#8221; line. In planning the trip he had dutifully arranged all the travel documents, but wasn&#8217;t quite aware to the scrutiny he would face beyond Eitoan. Here the customs officials were stricter, and his Ice States visa aroused suspicion. They discussed holding him for more information, but after a short call to the Agarese General Counsel their tone changed, and they waved him through. <br><br>Clearing customs, he looked around and found his guides, sent by the Consulate, a tall, thin mustachioed Mokan, and a short, round faced middle aged woman in a gray pantsuit, sent by the Counsulate. Accompanying them was serious looking man, gray suit, smart white shirt and green tie, with a well groomed pointed beard. The woman motioned him to come over, and introduced herself as Olivia Bartkova, a foreign service officer, and her companion as Augustin Labrador. The bearded official stepped forward, announcing &#8220;Xavier Cortez, concierge of the PUF Foreign Ministry, at your service&#8221; in impeccable Dienstadi. Olivia offered to put him up for the night in the busy commercial district, and, tired, he decided to take her up on the offer, preferring to continue on the next day. They piled into a stretch limousine. As they plied the streets of Motokata City, Jonas&#8217; eyes opened widely, despite his fatigue. Here was a world class city to rival Kelso! The avenues in the downtown were a neon infused assault on the senses! They accompanied him into the Castillo de Santa Catalina on Palad Street, clearly reserved for the very wealthy and foreign dignitaries by the look of it, and arranged to pick him up the next morning to make the 9:55 AM train to the Icer border. Bright and early the next morning, after his room service breakfast, they appeared in the lobby and whisked him off to the train depot, an edifice obviously handsome in it&#8217;s day, but now needing update. The trip there was less pleasant. Narrow streets choked with traffic, pedestrians everywhere, Jonas was glad the Tribunal was impressed with his lodgings, but with the congestion and so many people about he was glad the tribunal wasn&#8217;t held there! At the station they helped him navigate his way through the main hall and purchase his ticket. Thee was a lot of rapid fire back and forth between Olivia, Augustin, and the ticket agent, all of , of it in Mokan. At this point Jonas was second guessing what he&#8217;d gotten into. This was all unfamilar territory. &#8220;Well&#8221;, he reasoned, maybe Southport City would be better. He entered an aged, smoke filled car, noisy with families, and was off to the border. As he picked up conversations, the language was less familiar. It was in Moto, of course, the language of the provinces, almost unknown in Agar-Na. He had assumed that everyone in Motokata spoke Mokan. Jonas was deep in his own thoughts as the train got underway. As a kid in Trencin, in the eastern duchies he hadn&#8217;t much interest in travelling the world. Up through high school he&#8217;d assumed he&#8217;d follow into his dad&#8217;s grocery store. But in his junior year an embezzlement trial caught his attention, and he decided to investigate law. This led him to Bratislava University and opened his eyes to the wide world. He performed well in his exit exams, and was offered a job with a firm in Dolne Yadikov It looked promising, and his success at court was noticed by Duke Slany, who appointed him to a bench on the Basic Court, and later to the Superior Court. His reputation was fair and honest, and he did receive some notice after the war for his service on the Lord High Attorney General&#8217;s Panel for Review of Wartime Damages. Perhaps that is what led to the Icer&#8217;s offer. Once or twice he stretched, and paced the car. A few curious passengers struck up conversations with him. Dressed in suit and tie, he stood out among the more casually attired locals. Unfamiliar with his country he was peppered with questions by a farmer and his family who seemed fascinated. He also had occasion to chat with a local court magistrate, who seemed wary of anything to do with The Ice States. Such was the remnant animosity of the recent war there.<br><br>As the journey wore on the car emptied out. Along the final leg of the trip the landscape became more desolate. Although Motokata hadn&#8217;t been on the receiving end of much of the fighting, the frontier had been heavily militarized, and there were signs of battle as they approached. They passed mostly empty space, cleared from the tracks. Occasionally there were work crews, military engineers along with civilian contractors rebuilding bombed and shelled structures and repairing power lines and roadways. In the distance there were fields and a few hamlets of scattered houses. Train stations became fewere and far between, many of them boarded up. A sign appeared signaling the approach to the border. Guardhouses, however, were largely abandoned. The train halted at a buffer, a sign annoncing Danao/Wexford Crossing, Have Papers Ready. The passengers filed off, stern looking border guards closely inspecting all documents. Jonas took up his bags, shuffled down a two lane street a few blocks, and approached the demarcation line. Two Mokan sentries, frowning, inspected his passport and visas, and called their counterparts across the line. Three equally stern Icer soldiers came out to meet them. There was a brief discussing between the two groups, thankfully in Dienstadi. A tall, sandy haired Icer private motioned for Jonas to approach. He called over his sergeant, who inspected the diplomatic visa.<br><br>While the border guards were discussing the particulars of his documents, an older, well worn corporal bade him to rest up at a nearby holding area. Sparse quarters for sure. Next to the field and bleachers where he sat was a fortified guardhouse, heavily bombed. The roof was largely missing, windows shot out, walls pockmarked by gunshots. In front of it stood a sandbag reinforced trench, with a a makeshift dugout command post.<br><br>Twenty five minutes later, after lengthy, noisy discussion in Mokan, the guards waved across the border. On the other side there were no border guards. More armed Mokans. One forlorn old man, in red armband, carrying a briefcase.<br>The elderly gentleman spoke up. &#8220;Ah, Judge Dobrovodsky, The Communal Union welcomes you&#8221;. The accompanying sergeant broke into a toothy grin. &#8220;As you can see, our gracious Mokan comrades are extending us a lengthy, firm helping hand.&#8221; He smiled wanly. &#8220;They will be joining us to the demarcation line, where our other friends from Holy Marsh will be hosting us. I would have arranged a more elaborate welcoming party, but you see, our PUF visitors have been busy rooting out imperial agent holdovers among the foreign service and security forces, so, I&#8217;m it. Me and Sargeant Lucas here are the only ones the Communal Union have to greet you, at least until we&#8217;re out of the PUF occupation zone.&#8221;<br><br>Tired, Jonas shrugged &#8220;Very well then. Lead on&#8221;. <br><br>&#8220;Yes, of course. If you&#8217;ll please follow me&#8221;.<br><br>The Mokan border guards accompanying the party into Oldwich stared at Jonas. They didn&#8217;t get much traffic at their outpost, and certainly no foreign dignitaries. <br><br>A fog had enveloped the border crossing that afternoon. The scene seemed to be cut from a vintage film noir classic. The Icers dumped his luggage into the back of a large black SUV. The SUV, accompanied by two armored cars before and after it took off down a winding road, feeding into a main highway, travelling on priority across the expanse of Oldwitch, stopping outside of Wintercourt for clearance to traverse the expanse of Oldwitch and Southport held by the Holy Marsh, and again at the Oldwitch/Southport line along the coastal road before finally reaching Southport City. Jonas sighed as they unloaded his luggage and showed him to his rooms.<br><br>Tomorrow he would be introduced to the Tribunal.</div>

However it seems that new chains are now being placed on the Icer with the establishment of a Communist regime which we suspect came as a bi product of cooperation and assistance in the overthrow of the former King from the Holy Marsh. Therefore the Greater Ordenite Reich will not be recognizing The Ice States as a nation state and instead The Ice States will be considered as a rogue entity whose lands have and are essentially in the process of going into anarchy. All Ice States vessels and aircraft will be considered rogue and not belonging to any lawful nation currently existing within Greater Dienstad. It has yet to be decided if the current blockade against The Ice States which was put into place in protest of slavery will continue however the Kriegsmarine vessels will remain in the area for the foreseeable future until reason can be shown to the people of The Ice States that the Communist Union is a fate worse than death.</div></blockquote></div>

The high ceilings were braced by limestone pillars, which shot out of the periphery of the space like towers. The marble floors were polished to a shine, nearly providing a mirror reflection of the furniture it supported. A long line of oak and pine furnishings served as the bench for the justices, who gazed upon the rest of the room like sentries manning a palisade. Before them were the all-too-familiar stations for the combatants&#8211; the prosecution to the justice&#8217;s right, the defense to their left. But these two broad tables proved miniscule to the rows upon rows of cushioned benches, nearly all filled, that lurked close behind them, taking up nearly half the chamber. Between the representation&#8217;s stations and the justices, off to the side of the room, lay the enclosed prisoners docket; a lower row in front for translators, and a higher one for the prisoners themselves. A stream of administrative assistants, translators, and legal experts trekked across the room like a line of ants, individually random but part of a calculated chaos in the bigger picture. This hall, within the guts of the former regional administration building, was nearly perfect for their purposes&#8211; even although the room, with no natural light and what light existed being provided by orange-tinged fluorescents, gave it a gloomy impression. <br><br>Though the room was just as much of a racket as it was before, Pavel Ilyin could tell it was winding down. Leaving his interpreter headphones to an attendant to set up, Ilyin straightened himself out and stepped off the stand, moving to the podium opposite to the prisoner&#8217;s docket. Breathing deep, he flattened his prepared speech against the podium&#8217;s surface and breathed deeply. The hall quickly settled into a quiet murmur as all present now listened alertly to him. Knowing his words would need to be translated into at least four languages, Ilyin spoke clearly and slowly, pausing occasionally for emphasis.<br><br>&#8220;Murder, on a terrible scale, is what brings us all here today. Hundreds of thousands of innocents lie dead for want of human decency and mercy. The blood of my brothers, and my sisters, stains the soil of a faraway land for reasons so simpleminded, so wicked, and so revolting. No doubt many others share this sentiment. No doubt many others see the great transgressions that have been committed. No doubt, across the free world, there are many who pledge to never see this inhumanity repeated. This trial, I hope you know, my colleagues, and all others present, is of severe importance. Greater Dienstad has been continually drenched with blood, and though these proceedings may not have any bearing on that going forward let me make clear that those who instigate these wars are criminals for the bloodshed and barbarity they create. Those who cast the first stones commit crimes against not their own country&#8217;s laws but those of a higher plane, those against mankind, international peace, and its prosperity. We may not be able to put every warmongerer on the stand today, but we have, nonetheless, a unique opportunity. This opportunity, one that does not occur often, allows us to apply the even hand of law and international justice to those who would otherwise have gone unanswered for their actions and roles in atrocities. It is vital that we take this opportunity in the coming days to the fullest extent&#8211; for every exercise of justice against those brought to this procedure ensures that elsewhere, in some other time, this process will be brought against offenses that the world need not see repeated. This trial is just as important to the prosecution and defense as it is those it has wronged&#8211; I must urge those that represent the defendants, and those that serve as the prosecution, to act in a way that is worthy not only of respect from your countrymen, but to the esteem of every man and woman across the face of the Earth. Their eyes are on you.<br><br>&#8220;Now, I must stress that this tribunal is not a routine process, nor should it be treated as such. The crimes which have been committed, in their scale and calculated malice, warrant none other than a scrutinizing special legal procedure that we all attend today. As such, we must not only look beyond infractions of specific conditions of existing law, but hold up the actions of the individuals tried here to the norms of human goodwill. These crimes cannot be, and ought not to be, summarized so rudely as &#8216;felonies&#8217;, &#8216;misdemeanors&#8217;, or otherwise. Do not mistake me, many of these are none other than crimes against humanity. They should be prosecuted as such. In my experience, I have often seen my nation&#8217;s laws circumvented, ignored, and trampled. Laws are violated routinely, or are abused in their construction as to benefit those who believe themselves above justice. This is because <span style="font-style: italic">laws</span> are tangible&#8211; violable, vulnerable, limited. No proper system of justice can operate merely by setting down a line, and punishing those who cross it without consideration of the line itself. Then there would be no thought for what <span style="font-style: italic">needs</span> to be done; there would be no movement towards a more just society, only a more punitive one. I have fought forty years in the pursuit of what I believe is just, and I believe that what is just is not simply upholding <span style="font-style: italic">laws</span>, but pursuing and realizing <span style="font-style: italic">the law</span>. <span style="font-style: italic">Law</span> is synonymous with justice&#8211; it is an ideal, it is what ought to be, and it is what even some of our leaders fail to notice. <span style="font-style: italic">Laws</span>, on the other hand, apply to ordinary crimes, and ordinary criminals, but for our purposes we must draw from that other sphere of <span style="font-style: italic">law</span>; in its abstract, we will see the offenses of those brought here today in full color, reaching beyond flat legalese not in a bullet-point list of infringements of all too short-sighted <span style="font-style: italic">laws</span>. <br><br>&#8220;With this in mind, we must realize our purpose in gathering here today. It is not to put the noose around every individual, one way or another. In a manner of speaking, we will not attempt to try individuals based on their individual crimes, but to put on trial what they represent. It is a simple enough matter to execute one man. It&#8217;s a far more difficult task to prosecute the vile machinations they pursued, and what those like them will pursue worldwide. Like I said, we will not prosecute individuals in this trial, as to not overzealously distribute admittedly much-deserved vengeance. But we will charge them based on their complicity in what they represent, in the crimes that we denounce and put on trial in the coming days. I believe mankind will find it more than rewarding to put the criminals and their crimes at rest in the scales of justice. <br><br>&#8220;I praise the governments who have contributed their justices to help get to the bottom of this matter, and I praise the justices themselves for leveraging their expertise and much-needed intellect. I thank the court today for allowing me to share some words on what I believe should carry us throughout this process, and because of that, I commend the new government which inhabits the Ice States for organizing this trial. It is a much needed push towards accountability that this region needs. I trust the prosecution, and the defense, to adequately pursue their ends using all means available and help not only this court, but humanity, uncover the grievous offenses that have been perpetrated. Warfare and bloodshed may be constants, but it is our obligation and sole solace to deliver justice after the matter, should we exercise this privilege dutifully. Let us commit ourselves to the pursuit of truth, justice, and humanity. <br><br>&#8220;I hand the proceedings over to the court.&#8221;<br><br>Ilyin nodded to the Icer bailiff, who read off the procedure of the court. A pre-trial decision had been made to try each offender individually, following the same format: prosecutors presenting evidence, witnesses, and arguments against the defendant, the defense being given time to rebut and provide their own counter-evidence, and closing arguments for each side, respectively. Verdicts would be made by the judges along the way, to be discussed in breaks during the proceedings, before being finally presented to the tribunal. Punishment would be decided from there. There would be no appeals process, given the special nature of the trial. <br><br>The bailiff then introduced the first prisoner on the docket. With the flash of a far-off camera, the prosecution began.</div>

After the first conference with the representatives of the Communist Icer government, she took a flight to Fedala where she conferred His Imperial Majesty Fedor and a number of other kr&#237;erlords. Although they were displeased by the Icer government&#8217;s commitment to a pure sort of capitalism that would unravel the strides in cross-border trade that had been flourishing these past weeks, there was also a prevailing sentiment that the Golden Throne should avoid a long, drawn-out conflict over the status of the Green Zone. Lara did not return to the Satrapy of Nicaro until she had an approved plan of action, an offer that she could make, the Icers could accept, and that they could all sign off on. It took three days of work, and two nights, but finally His Imperial Majesty contented himself with a sort of compromise deal. Well, it was a compromise for the Golden Throne. Whether the communists would recognize that, nobody knew. Everyone knew that the communist animal thought differently from the rational man.<br><br>Some within the Kr&#237;erlord Kuncil had demanded war. If the communists didn&#8217;t give in, they said, then the Golden Throne would create a military regime in the north, which it would then gradually transition toward democracy. That regime could be given an army, weapons, and all the supplies it needed to fight a war against the communists. But, the voice for war in within the Kuncil had been dimming in recent years. The Gothic War, as the invasion of the Scandinvan Empire was known, had drained the imperial coffers and imperial resources had been stretched to fight the war with the Fourth Reich in Krasnova and Killia. Insurgencies persisted in Nicaro, New Empire, Krasnova, and Indras, and the Havenic Frontier was no longer as stable and dominated as it once had been &#8212; Communist Safehaven was stirring again. Naturally, the weight of the Kr&#237;erlord Kuncil stood against making yet <span style="font-style: italic">another</span> enemy and starting <span style="font-style: italic">another</span> war, and so the Golden Throne&#8217;s commitment to free trade was for once restrained for the sake of maintaining the peace with a neighboring state.<br><br>With the offer in hand, Lara returned to Matagalpa, Nicaro. Before taking off, she sent word to Jogornos Frogeder, who had stayed behind in Magecastle, Ice States, to oversee the reconstituted diplomatic embassy to that country. He was instructed to have his staff organize a second round of talks with the Communal Union. While she was flying over the ocean to Nicaro, he did that. Hours later, in Matagalpa, Lara immediately took another flight, this time to Magecastle.<br><br>Once again, the Ice States would be represented primarily by Alexander Nicholas Savercehnko-Colleti. Along with him came Courtney Hazelbush, and Lyda Straub, both of whom were also present in the previous round of negotiations. This time, only one diplomatic aide was present, rather than two, tasked with providing any services to the diplomats present, as was in the previous round of negotiations.<br><br>The previous negotiations had failed, and now the stakes were higher. If these failed, it would be highly unlikely that future negotiations would be successful. While the Ice States was prepared to go to war to liberate its territories in Ormont, the fact is that the Golden Throne remained an extremely powerful nation with a large number of allies, and it would not be the wisest choice to go to war with the Golden Throne for a newly-formed regime.<br><br>The Ice diplomats escorted the Macabean diplomats to the negotiation room, where they would meet to determine the fate of the zone. Once again, Saverchenko-Colleti offered drinks to the diplomats present, which were to be provided by the aide. He then spoke to introduce the meeting. &#8220;While the previous negotiations regarding this matter were not&#8230;able to form a mutual agreement, I &#8211; and the rest of the Ice States &#8211; remain of the opinion that a diplomatic solution to this matter is preferable to having Ice or Macabean blood spilled in a prolonged conflict in the Northern parts of the Ice States, especially after the bloody conflict already suffered within the Ice States.&#8221;<br><br>Surr was expressionless when she said, &#8220;Indeed. Besides,&#8221; she continued, after a pause, &#8220;if it came to war it would be a very long time before northern Ormont was returned to the Ice States. All the same, His Imperial Majesty is interested in pursuing good neighborly relations with the Ice States, regardless of the&#8230;nature&#8230;of the regime in power. That is why He has personally authorized me to make a new offer, one that should be more amenable to your ideological criteria. Before I make the offer, it ought to be clear that the Golden Throne is still interested in pursuing its commercial interests in the Ice States and in maintaining the security of its Nicaroan frontier. Those two fundamental needs of ours are non-negotiable. Consequently, apart from an economic agreement, it is important to us that the basic terms of TOCAIF continued to be upheld by your government. We can reconfigure the treaty language as needed. I suppose that your government will no longer need funding for a prison program or anything of that nature, but we expect your government to cooperate fully in the capture and extradition of Nicaroan insurgents who cross the Frontier into your country. That the Ice States is not a safe haven for those guerrillas is imperative for us to corner and defeat them. That aside, we are prepared to leave behind our demand for free trade and a special administrative zone in the north. Instead, we will turn the Green Zone over to your government for administration and withdraw our troops within the next four weeks if your government itself guarantees the expected annual volume of trade between our states. In precise terms, we require an annual purchase of Macab&#233;an goods by your government valued at &#342;175 billion each year &#8212; your government can determine which goods it imports on the basis of its need, what matters to us is the monetary value.&#8221;<br><br>The diplomats each carefully listened as the Macab&#233;an representative finished his statement. Once she indeed finished speaking, the Ice diplomats looked at each other. These conditions were far more acceptable to the Communal Union than the previous demands by the Golden Throne. Hazelbush, once again, spoke to reinforce the statement&#8217;s authority; but this time was careful not to antagonize the Golden Throne, given the gravity of the matter. &#8220;We are certainly amenable to considering these criteria, such that we wish to debate this more extensively within our government before coming up with a definitive response. Prima facie, these seem reasonable, but we would also like some clarifications from your nation to facilitate our making of a decision on this matter. Specifically, what is the nature of the Nicaroan insurgents we would combat as part of the reestablished Tocaif deal, and how much discretion, if any, will we receive in combatting insurgents&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;In what sense do you mean?&#8221; asked Surr, looking for clarification.<br><br>Saverchenko-Colleti now replied. &#8220;Could you elaborate on the nature of the Nicaroan insurgents we would be obligated to keep from our jurisdiction as part of the renewed Tocaif deal?<br><br>Surr replied, &#8220;They are guerrilla fighters belonging to several groups operating in southern Nicaro, along the frontier area. Over the past couple of years, we have successfully boxed them into an ever smaller area, but it is known that they use the frontiers to temporarily escape our pressure and regroup. It makes fully eliminating them more difficult. I&#8217;m sure that your military can more than fill you in on the insurgents, their characteristics, and how they operate. But it&#8217;s obviously politically imperative that your government cooperate with ours in sealing the frontier against their movement, including and especially by arresting and handing them over.&#8221;<br><br>After Surr finished, there was a brief silence before Saverchenko-Colleti, once again, spoke. &#8220;We have one more question for your nation. Should we accept this deal after it is formally considered within our government, would the Golden Throne be able to formally&#8230;guarantee that it will not engage in armed action within our jurisdiction without our consent, as to prevent disagreements such as this from arising in the future? We would also hold no objections against guaranteeing that the Ice States also will not engage in such actions within the Golden Throne.&#8221;<br><br>That was an unexpected question although Surr didn&#8217;t show any hint of it. But clearly, no real such guarantee could ever be issued. Who knew what the future held? And why wouldn&#8217;t the Golden Throne act in a similar way if there was a requirement to do so. What she said was, &#8220;I can guarantee that the Golden Throne will not undertake a hostile action against the communist government of the Ice States under two conditions: that we are not attacked and that the terms of this treaty are adhered to.&#8221;<br><br>Saverchenko-Colleti replied once more. &#8220;If the Golden Throne does not engage in armed hostility towards the Ice States then we have no reason to engage in armed action against the Golden Throne either. We therefore can indeed guarantee that the Ice States will not attack Macab&#233;an territory or otherwise engage in hostility towards the Golden Throne, should the Golden Throne also refrain from engaging in hostilities towards the Ice States.&#8221;<br><br>The Macab&#233;an kr&#237;erlord nodded. &#8220;Then take these terms back to your government for approval. If there is an agreement, we can formalize the treaty terms at the imperial embassy here, in Magecastle. I give formal authority to Jogornos Frogeder to sign on my behalf an agreement in accordance to the terms discussed here. With that being said, it was a pleasure as always, gentlemen.&#8221; She stood and offered to shake their hands before leaving.</div></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 116%;">(Ooc: Parts of this post contributed by <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Ahsca">Ahsca</a> and <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=Tangatarehua">Tangatarehua</a>.)</span><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfR6_V91fG8" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Starless.</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Southport City, The Ice States.</span><br><br>The room was cold. And the hammer of justice which was going to fall in this trial would also fall cold, especially given the severity of the charges. The prosecution waited for the Czaslyudian delegate to finish. They were to be represented by Jack Houghwout as Chief Prosecutor. Once the Czaslyudian finished, Houghwout spoke.<br><br>"Thank you, your honour. I rise to speak here on behalf of all victims of the former imperial Ice regime, which for far too long oppressed and murdered its own citizens in the pursuit of theocracy and racial purity. In this trial, all responsible for the sins of the former regime shall now feel justice rightfully delivered on them. I begin with the prosecution of Robert McShane, for his complicity in the persecution of Czaslyudians residing in the Ice States in Operation Diamond Dog. While all here are likely already aware of Operation Diamond Dog, but to summarise the facts, the operation, which we find represents a state-sanctioned genocide of the Czaslyudian population of the Ice States, was originally commenced by luring Czaslyudians to various black sites throughout the Ice States, where they would be brutally killed. Then, a secret police was established to locate Czaslyudians who survived the first phase, and execute them once it was fully certain that they were Czaslyudian or of Czaslyudian descent."<br><br>"The following test applies to determine the complicity of an individual in this trial..."<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>3. A defendant shall be considered complicit in an act if it is proven that the defendant knowingly<br><br><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>aided, abetted, or performed said act as part of a discretionary function;<br><br></li><li>sanctioned, authorised, organised, or otherwise directed said act in a position of leadership; or<br><br></li><li>failed to make a bona fide effort to prevent or punish said act, despite (i) being aware of said act and (ii) holding a position of leadership allowing the defendant to control the conduct of those persons who directly engaged in said act sufficiently to prevent or punish the act in question.</li></ol></div></blockquote><br><br>"In this case, the prosecution believes that the defendant would be guilty under 3b complicity. Specifically, the defendant was personally responsible for training and organising a portion of the secret police established to support Operation Diamond Dog. As evidence of this, we wish to display DVR-CCTV audio footage from the Emerstead military base, seized by Marshite forces during their invasion of the same city. We have prepared a witness from the Marshite military to testify for the authenticity of the footage; but for the moment, we would like to show the footage to all here in the trial. Notably, it shows the defendant McShane acting in his capacity as a Colonel in the imperial Ice military to direct various operatives in Operation Diamond Dog, which we find clearly falls into the category of 'direct[ing] said act in a position of leadership'."<br><br>A small, yellow USB drive was loaded into the screen at the front of the room. The screen flickered, before loading the footage. The footage was then advanced to the relevant section, and began to play.<br><br>"Attention," exclaimed McShane. Little green men -- around thirty -- assembled themselves in two formations in front of McShane. Among them was Sergeant Neville Gant, who had barely been in the Ice military for a year, yet had already shown himself to be one of the most loyal and proficient members of the Ice military. It was only a matter of short time before they would reach the rank of Major.<br><br>"As you certainly are already aware, it was only recently that a war concluded between the Ice States and the Federal Republic of Czaslyudian Peoples, over in the Northwest of Greater Dienstad. However, it is certainly likely that Czaslyudians and the FRCP will continue to pose a threat to the sovereignty of the Ice States. Who knows if the belligerent regime decides some new aspect of our nation to criticise and start a war over?"<br><br>"I am therefore proud to annouce Operation Diamond Dog, a program which has been in the works for a long time by now. It is effectively a purge of Czaslyudian immigrants and descendants thereof from the Ice States, preventing their presence from posing a threat to the sovereignty of our proud nation." McShane continued speaking, describing all the details of the operation. Then, however, began the important part.<br><br>McShane continued speaking. "Now, you may wonder why I am telling you all this. The reason is that you have been called to here as you have been selected to serve as an operative in the second stage of Diamond Dog. You will each be assigned various individuals believed to be Czaslyudian or of Czaslyudian descent. Your job will be to infiltrate their lives, and gain their trust. Find out if they are indeed a Czaslyudian or a descendant thereof. If they are, then promptly deliver them to the Emerstead Blacksite, where you can execute them. The blacksite can be found..."<br><br>He continued, on and on, and it was about ten minutes more before the footage was turned off. "Our material evidence has now been presented. To conclude our case, we find that, as the defendant instructed his inferiors in the imperial Ice military on acting as operatives for Operation Diamond Dog, they 'knowingly directed' the genocide 'in a position of leadership'. Now, we would like the request that the court allow us to present our witnesses."<br><br>Taking her seat upon the bench with her fellow judges with her documents before her, it was finally time to get started. Yuzumi put on the headset provided for her for interpretation and listened to the opening statements put forth by the leading judge. A fine stirring speech to open with, perfect way to set up this whole tribunal. Now underway, it was time to begin hearing the case from the Prosecution itself. Watching all the footage was tough, she&#8217;d seen plenty on the bench in her 6-years but this felt like a new level of shock. Well still, she had to keep composure, it is important to weigh all evidence carefully and after the first of physical evidence was the presentation of witnesses. The Chief Judge deferred to her to see to the swearing. &#8220;Very good. The criteria to determine guilt or lack thereof is hereby established. Prosecution Exhibit A is entered into evidence. Prosecution may call up its first witness.&#8221; The first witness, the Marshite military colonel Aujika Veridas, was called up. &#8220;Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I swear that I will do so in complete good faith. Further, I understand that failure to do so may be prosecuted as perjury, and works against the ideals of justice which form the basis for this trial. Thank you, you may be seated. Mr. Houghwout, you may begin.&#8221;<br><br>"On behalf of the prosecution, our first question is as follows. Were you a participant in the Marshite invasion of Emerstead, on September 1418?"<br><br>After a brief hesitation, Veridas spoke. "I was indeed a participant in the Marshite invasion of Emerstead that month."<br><br>"Now, are you aware of any CCTV footage seized by the Marshite military during the invasion from the Emerstead military base?"<br><br>"Yes, the Marshite military seized DVR-CCTV footage from the base, after the city was secured."<br><br>"Can you confirm that this footage is the same as Exhibit A, what was just played by the prosecution?"<br><br>"I can confirm that the footage which was just played is the same as what was seized by the Marshite invasion force."<br><br>Houghwout turned to the Ahscan justice. "Thank you, your honour. Our questioning is complete."<br><br>The questioning of the witness by Mr. Houghwout commenced allowing the full telling of more information. Once finished, Yuzumi spoke. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Houghwout. Does Defense Counsel wish to cross examine?&#8221; The defense remained ominously silent, such that Yuzumi then spoke again. "In that case, are there any other witnesses the prosecution would like to present?"<br><br>Houghwout now replied. "Yes, your honour. We would like to present Neville Gant as our next witness." After the witness was sworn in, Houghwout turned to the witness and then spoke. "Were you present in the meeting shown in Exhibit A, the footage played by the prosecution?"<br><br>"I was indeed present in the same meeting," replied Gant.<br><br>"Can you confirm that Exhibit A accurately shows events during the meeting?"<br><br>Now, if they were true, it would also both prove and disprove Gant's guilt under 3a. It would confirm that Gant was involved in performing Operation Diamond Dog; it would also prove that he did so as a matter of being ordered, such that his role in the genocide could not be argued to fit under the "discretionary function" umbrella. The risk of being prosecuted for perjury was also great. Gant had now elected to answer the question truthfully, but would also be content to answer questions submitted by the defense; and more so than to answer questions by the prosecution. "I can confirm that Exhibit A accurately depicts what happened in the meeting in question," he replied.<br><br>"Can you confirm the identity of the leader of the meeting?"<br><br>"Yes, the leader of the meeting is indeed Robert McShane."<br><br>"Can you also confirm the rank McShane held in the imperial Ice military at the time of the meeting?"<br><br>"I can confirm that, at the time, McShane held the rank of a Colonel."<br><br>Houghwout, once again, turned to the courts to announce the end of the prosecution's interrogation of the witness. Yuzumi once again spoke. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Houghwout. Does Defense Counsel wish to cross examine this witness?&#8221; Now, this answer effectively sealed the case in the favour of the prosecution; yet, there was still time for the defense to rebut.<br><br>Now, the response was in the implicit affirmative. Ambrose Maccallum, the Devonian lawyer who would be leading the defense of the indictees, now rose to speak. There was indeed a solid opportunity for the defense to question a relatively high-ranking member of the Ice imperial military, who would logically seek to, where possible, answer in a manner which would assist the defense. "The defense would like to ask of the witness if any Colonel in the Imperial Ice military, other than McShane, present in the meeting?"<br><br>"Yes, Colonel Paul Tibett was present."<br><br>"Was Colonel Tibett's role in Operation Diamond Dog also instructed by the defendant during the meeting?"<br><br>"Yes, Tibett was instructed in his participation in Operation Diamond Dog during the meeting, along with all others present."<br><br>"That closes the cross-examination of the witness by the defense."<br><br>"We would like a redirect," spoke Houghwout.<br><br>"Very well," spoke now Ariki Taneti, the delegate from Tangatarehua. "The prosecution may question the witness again."<br><br>"Was any other Ice military personnel at or above the rank of Colonel present?"<br><br>"To my knowledge, no other member was present of higher or equal rank than Colonel."<br><br>"Our questioning is complete."<br><br>With the prosecution's case now complete, Taneti once again spoke. "As the prosecution has finished presenting its case, the defense may now speak."<br><br>Maccallum now spoke. "Regardless of whether the prosecution has demonstrated that the defendant did 'organise' part of Operation Diamond Dog, it has failed to demonstrate that such organisation occured 'in a position of leadership', the second prong of the act of complicity that the prosecution has attempted to show under 3b. The intent of this would appear to be that the defendant must have authority over those present. However, this was not necessarily the case during the meeting. As we have shown with our cross-examination of the witness Neville Gant, at least one individual was present and his participation in the operation also directed, despite being of equal rank to the defendant. This makes it likely that said meeting was not one where the defendant used his rank to direct the others present. There is no identifiable alternative 'position of leadership' under which the defendant directed the act, according to the prosecution. This creates a reasonable doubt on the defendant's guilt, such that we do not believe that the prosecution has sufficiently demonstrated that the defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt."<br><br>The defense's argument was short; and it would be nigh-impossible to contest the footage provided by the prosecution, which during the discovery proceedings had already been seen by the defense. When the court allowed the prosecution to commence its closing argument, Houghwout promptly rose to speak.<br><br>"To conclude the prosecution's case against this defendant, we find that the defendant, having instructed members of the Ice imperial military to participate in Operation Diamond Dog, did certainly 'direct said act'. We would also diverge from the statement by the defense that we have not shown that the defendant did so as part of a 'position of leadership'. Regardless of rank -- despite the fact that there was only one individual of equal or higher rank to the defendant during the meeting, as shown by the testimony of the witness Gant -- having been permitted to instruct Ice military personnel on Operation Diamond Dog placed the defendant in a 'position of leadership'. We believe that the defendant, having therefore been responsible for directing the operation, ought to be convicted as early as possible at this rare opportunity. We would also encourage the court to consider the highest possible punishment for the defendant, given the severity of the act of leadership in genocide. Our closing argument is complete."<br><br>"Excellent," spoke Taneti. "The defense may now present its closing argument."<br><br>Maccallum now rose to speak on behalf of the defense. "To conclude the defense of this individual, we remain of the opinion that the defense has still failed to prove that the defendant's organisation of the operation they claim occured was from a 'position of leadership'. The interpretation of this language in the law according to the prosecution would go strongly against the spirit of the law, such that it ought not to be enforced. If any act of 'sanction[ing], authoris[ing], organis[ing], or otherwise direct[ing] said act' necessarily placed the defendant in a 'position of leadership', what would the point of the second prong of the clause be? We therefore find that the prosecution must be able to prove that the defendant was already in a position of leadership before engaging in the acts in the first prong of the test. This was not shown by the prosecution, and therefore we believe that the defendant should be exonerated from the charges brought in this trial. We have finished presenting our closing argument."<br><br>"Would the prosecution like to present any rebuttal?" The answer was silence; it was unlikely that continued conversation would be productive, with both the prosecution and the defense already having provided all arguments they could provide. "This trial is closed", spoke the justice.</div>

If the Ice States was "a rogue entity whose lands have and are essentially in the process of going into anarchy", why was the Reich also a nation? And how is it not true that the Reich "is a fate worse than death"? It appeared that the threat was nothing more than a show of hypocrisy from a nearby pariah state.<br><br>Publicly, three main measures were taken. Firstly, all Ordenite vessels were now barred from entering Ice waters or airspace. Secondly, the Ice States would dispatch land and air military forces to the coasts of Isborgir, which would prevent any Ordenite incursion into Ice waters or airspace. Finally, a government statement was issued by the Ice States, condemning the Ordenite Reich. It read as follows.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Statement on threats by the Ordenite Reich</span></span></div><br><hr><br>Shortly after the formation of the Communal Union, the self-proclaimed "Ordenite Reich Chancellery" issued a public statement. The <a href="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=40340973#p40340973" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, while brief, insulted the Communal Union and its form of government throughout. Among its outrageous statements are that "new chains are now being placed on the Icer with the establishment of a Communist regime", that the Ice States is "a rogue entity whose lands have and are essentially in the process of going into anarchy", and that "the Communist Union is a fate worse than death". It also contains a number of threats made towards our nation, stating that "all Ice States vessels and aircraft will be considered rogue", while threatening a resumed blockade against the nation.<br><br>This statement ultimately represents yet another show of sheer hypocrisy from a pariah state, which, despite its insults and threats directed towards the Communal Union, is in fact nothing more than a despotic dictatorship ruled by a number of paranoid cowards. It should be noted the number of atrocities the Reich has committed towards both its own citizens and other innocents around the world, including but not limited to its imprisonment of millions of Ordenites on concentration and forced labour camps throughout the nation, its genocides against peoples from Holy Panooly and the Red Star Union, and now its recent stirring up of armed conflict within the nation of Wanderjar. Indeed, these actions have been so grave as to have been <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolution/id=272/council=2" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">formally condemned by the World Assembly</a>, a far more reputable body than the Reich itself.<br><br>We do not take such threats against our nation lightly. As such, effective immediately we shall commence action against the Ordenite Reich from within our jurisdiction. Specifically, no Ordenite vessel shall be permitted within Ice waters or airspace. No new Ordenite vessel may enter the same, and vessels which are currently under Ice jurisdiction must be removed within 72 hours of the issuing of this statement. Further, we shall be placing marine and air military guards around our coasts, to deter Ordenite vessels from entering our jurisdiction. Finally, should the Reich commence any active military hostility towards the Ice States, it shall be taken as an act of war, and we shall respond with deadly force. We hope that the Reich can prove these measures unnecessary, but we find this to be unlikely, such that we must prepare for the worst.<br><br>Signed,<br><span style="font-style: italic">~Courtney Hazelbush,<br>Temporary General-President,<br>The Communal Union of the Ice States.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Antony Black,<br>Lead General of the Communist Freedom Army,<br>The Communal Union of the Ice States.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">~Lyda Straub,<br>Minister of Foreign Affairs,<br>The Communal Union of the Ice States.</span></blockquote><br><br>Privately, the Ice States also sent a secured communication to the government of Holy Marsh for aid in dealing with the Ordenite threat.

The new Communal Union finds itself in a perilous position. While negotiations with the Golden Throne seemed to be reaching a mutually beneficial conclusion, The Greater Ordenite Reich has threatened to maintain their blockade, and/or additional hostile actions. The Reich has chosen to consider the Communal Union a "rogue entity," a title it once bestowed upon the People's Unified Federation. <br><br>With these threats in mind, and a growing desire for the People's Unified Federation to foster relations with the new Communal Union, the PUF is offering some of its reserve stockpiles to the new government. An initial deal valued at $340 million will see the transfer of various coastal defense assets to new government of The Ice States. Details released by Juventud Island suggest four batteries of Manticore Missile Carriers, possibly totaling up to 24 carriers. Online resources show that these could carry 14 anti-ship cruise missiles each, for a potentially 336 missiles ready to fire. However, Juventud Island did not release the number of missiles, nor what kind, it was selling. Instead, they announced that four Tu-95 coastal patrol planes would also be sold, with current radar and ship tracking hardware and software. <br><br>It is believed that the PUF intends to give the Ice States the ability to track and intercept any Ordenite vessels that may illegally enter their waters.</div>

<div class="content">Judge Jonas Dobrodovsky settled into his seat on the bench. The previous two days were busy, meeting and greeting his fellow jurists, and with briefings regarding the finer points of legal procedures under the Communal Union. He was a bit familiar with the Czaslyudian legal system, and felt comfortable with Ilyin, who opened the proceedings. Perhaps they had been chosen to sit on the tribunal, given that the system in both their countries had evolved during their tenure, in Pavel&#8217;s case abruptly, in his case gradually since independence. They were present at possibly the birth of jurisprudence in the Communal Union. His synagogue also hosted Czaslyudian guests during the holidays from time to time, even though it follwed the Eitoan Original Revivalist liturgy which was not predominant in Nitra Duchy. He was highly impressed by Raiepi Ariki Taneti, by his standing as a Supreme Court Justice and his quick intelligence. Translators struggled with some phrases. There wern&#8217;t many fluent in both Maori and Dienstadi. And he was inrtrigued by Justice Kobyashi. AHSCA was distant, and seemed interesting. Perhaps he would visit there someday. Her system appeared to have some similarities to Agar-Na, with courts enjoying some autonomy under a ducal system.<br><br>The opening of the proceedings brought some questions to mind. Why was Ilyin facing the prisoners docket in the opening? Was this the custom in the Ice States? At home, judges remained seated at the bench throughout pleadings. Was this a novelty for this trial only? Would such action imply guilt for the defendants? The tribunal was supposed to operate under an assumption of innocence. Also at the start there appeared to be a delay in the translation. This could become a source of misunderstanding, especially in the ad-hoc nature of the proceedings. Dobrodovsky was surprised with Ilyin&#8217;s statement about the blood of his brothers and sisters. He could certainly understand Ilyin&#8217;s outrage at the murders committed under Operation Diamond Dog, but would that spoil the trial? Could the defense object during or after the proceedings? The words would probably not effect the outcome, all judges appeared impartial as should be expected. Perhaps Ilyin was just naturally garrulous. Perhaps he got carried away. On the other hand, it is brave that Ilyin mentioned circumvention of laws in Czaslyudia. It points to his objectivity, and to adherence to the higher principles of justice. He also liked that Ilyin alluded to law as synonymous with justice, compared to laws relating to ordinary crimes. In a court operating under ad-hoc justice, in a country starting over in establishing a legal system, the tribunals findings may become precedent to any direction the Communal Union may take, and as such should be guided by the highest standards. The allusion to &#8220;those like them will pursue worldwide&#8221; was trickier. Nearby, in the Shartourn this could raise some hackles. But that wasn&#8217;t on his plate today. That was balanced by noting the difficulty in prosecuting so as to not overzealously distribute vengeance. It was a complicated opening, and it&#8217;s impact would be seen as the trials proceeded.<br><br>Jonas began taking notes as Chief Prosecutor Jack Houghwout began. He read the applicable test to determine defendant Robert McShane&#8217;s guilt in the execution of Operation Diamond Dog. He read all three provisions. Guilt under any of the three provisions would result in conviction, and Houghwout specifically claimed Mc Shane&#8217;s guilt under provision 3b. But immediately Jonas thought that guilt under 3b would also prove guilt under the other provisions of the charge. As Houghwout indicated, by his own words Colonel McShane based Operation Diamond Dog on speculation of the actions of the government of Czaslyuda or those Czaslyudians resident in the Ice States after the conclusion of the war between The Ice States and Czaslyudia. And Operation Diamond Dog was, by McShane&#8217;s words themselves a mass murder of innocent Czaslyudians. He was sickened by McShane&#8217;s pride in announcing Operaton Diamond Dog. There was no disputing that the video was true. The defense declined to cross examine Colonel Veridas. And Major Grant&#8217;s testimony confirmed the chain of command at the meeting with McShane as the commanding officer.<br><br>The defense was risible. Colonel Tibett&#8217;s presence at the Emerstead conference failed to dispute McShane&#8217;s obvious leadership of the assembled group. There was no protest by Tibett, indicating that his role there was inferior to McShane. If he were of equal rank in the Diamond Dog organization, he would have also instructed the subordinates. And given the prosecution&#8217;s stated charge under the entirety of Article 3, per his experience under Agarese common law, all provisions show Colonel McShane&#8217;s guilt.<br><br>Conferring wih his fellow judges, Dobrodovsky argued for a guilty verdict. And he argued for guilt under all provisions, not only 3b. McShane clearly led the Emerstead meeting where the death orders were given by him. He stated that there was no contravening order by Tibett, placing hime clearly in command. And his orders did indeed put Operation Diamond Dog in motion, responsible for the genocide. <br><br>The next issue in his mind was framing the guilty verdict. Jonas favored a brief explanation of the cogent points leading to the decision, delivered en banc by the majority. Dissenting judges should be given a similar opportunity. Although he had always been cautious in this approach in his courtroom there were two points strongly in it&#8217;s favor here. The decision of the court was final. Since no appeal was possible, it was his opinion that the interests of the Icer public would be advanced in knowing the reasoning behind the verdict. And given the extraordinary circumstances of the trial and the early stages of Icer legal reform a summary of the decision could serve as a guidepost for their judges in the future.</div>
