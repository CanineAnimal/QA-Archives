The HMS Crowell was a part of RTF 53 escorting a group of oil and cargo ships to the crown. Now the ships where safely headed home with the rest of the RTF 53 but the HMS Crowell was headed to a mobile repair base, basically a group of ships far from the fray to repair ships on the high seas after battle and rearm.<br> <br>A 150nm from Stevid was a Naval Action Fleet all 289 ships with a super dreadnought as the flagship and almost 700 aircraft patrolling headed north, not far was another NAF headed southeast there was civilian ships everywhere moving like they had been for years now just being guarded from an imperialist empire that could shut down the flow of goods to other nations. <br><br>On the flagship of NAF 9, Admiral Celio Greco was in the command center on a VTC with the longsword commander and fleet headquarters back in Imbrinium. The main topic was intelligence and what happened with the HMS Crowell. <br><br>The intelligence reports seemed to be both good and bad; more nations seemed to be getting involved in the area. But the RIN and RIAF where deploying more aircraft for patrols and more fleets to cover more area and make a show of force more noticeable.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">HMS Diadem <br>Lemartes Class Destroyer<br>International Waters west of Stevidian South Greal</span></span><br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">HMS Diadem</span> had been one of the first of her class when the Lemartes Class was first put into mass production to replace nearly every AA destroyer class in the Royal Navy. She was, and remained to this day, one of the most powerful destroyers in the entire world, her capabilities lethal and unquestioned; the flag she flew &#8211; feared. <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Diadem</span> was a symbol of Stevidian naval and technological engineering. Yet she sat idle in water after her encounter with RIN destroyer.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span> had been on a routine patrol in international waters but the local regional tensions had changed her mission requirements. Captain O&#8217;Neill, a veteran from the last regional war with a career spanning 18-years, had ordered the <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span> to closely shadow a convoy belonging to Imbrinium. A cold war era tactic supposed to display power projection upon a foreign navy. This had elicited a hostile response from the escorting destroyer and after the <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span> ignored messages to leave (due to committing no international offence nor firing live rounds in provocation) was rammed by the enemy destroyer.<br><br>The result was significant damage to the stern of the <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span>. A minor hull rupture meant she was taking on water and the shaft damage was significant enough to kill almost all of her speed. Fortunately the <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span> was making back to port on &#8216;Get Me Home Speed&#8217; on one prop shaft at low revs while damage control teams attended to the damage. The opposing destroyer suffered damage herself but visually looked unscathed &#8211; nevertheless she two had slowed to almost a complete stop.<br><br>O&#8217;Neill had called action stations and condition red and the ship, despite the damage, was fully combat operational. The <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Diadem</span> was now astern of the enemy vessel and it was no secret to their opponent that the only thing stopping the Stevidian destroyer from blowing them out of the water was the captain&#8217;s cool head. The King Arthur helicopter had her ASW torpedoes removed and replaced with a short-medium range sea skimming anti-ship missile; this same helicopter was now lurking with intent to destroy the opposing ship with but a signal light from <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span>. Additional threats came in the form of two Royal Marine scrambler speed boats each with 20 marines on board ready to assault the destroyer as soon as the word was given. They kept close the mother ship for the time being, but at top speed could close on the enemy and be ready board in less than 3 minutes. <br><br>The Imbrinium vessel would also be aware of the forward missile tubes housing Gothic Type I anti-ship missiles, proven to cripple even super dreadnoughts and developed out of lessons from the War of Golden Succession. More obvious yet was the deck gun that was pointing dangerously towards the opposing destroyer. On the deck machine guns were manned and lower ratings were armed with smaller machine guns and semi-automatic rifles.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">HMS Diadem</span> limped home leaving her counterpart to sit helpless but ready to fight. 3-hours away was a Royal Navy recovery ship on its way to transport the <span style="font-style: italic">Diadem</span> back to Stevid for a full repair and refit in lieu of the damage caused. <br><br><div align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold">* * *</span></div><br><br>Back in Stevid, several emergency meetings had taken place with all heads of the armed forces and department heads from the Imperial Ministry of Defence. There had already been protests in the capital about the lack of action or even voice to towards the hostile states that were busy provoking Stevid into a war or words &#8211; and now a naval ramming.<br><br>But the discussions moved away from the ramming to more strategic affairs. Two satellite images and eight contact reports from submarines detailed huge ship movements believed to be from Imbrinium. In one of the satellite images a super dreadnought could be clearly seen and identified. However the actual force composition could not be ascertained (guessed to be 100+) and a satellite could not be moved into a geostationary position over north Greater Dienstad for another four days.<br><br>It was decided to stoke the fire further and no order was given to deploy a battle fleet despite one being present off east Morrdh that had been involved with Tehver crisis earlier in the year. This battle fleet was within easy striking range of Imbrinium and able to interdict any naval activities with just two days notice. This ace in the hole would be left unutilised for the time being, however its future use would probably come to pass. The fleet was ordered to move out further towards international waters and towards Imbrinium and conduct interstate war naval exercises and drills until needed.<br><br>In response to enemy fleet movements to Stevid&#8217;s north and east, three task forces would be dispatched from the 4th Fleet and would number around 30 fighting vessels, include a maximum of three carriers each, minus logistical support. These task forces would intercept and shadow enemy fleets at the maximum ferry range of the aircraft carried on the carriers.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, WAR ROOM</span></span><br><br>"Would someone be kind enough to explain to me what the hell is going on?"<br><br>President Benito Vera sat at the head of the table with his Military council, trying to determine what was the best course of action given the recent turn of events. It was merely a few months away from the next election but it seemed fate wanted to give the President a few more crisis before his final departure. As such he stood sitting up facing his Generalissimos and Admirals, eying them all with a dare to insult him. Belmotin was going according to schedule, but with Aqua Anu caught up in a drug war and now Stevid's movements and rumors of a move on Istegium, the president wanted answers now.<br><br>"I will begin Mr. President." Generalissimo Ivan Canarias puffed a cigar, calmly, either ignoring the presidents subtle anger or trying and failing to calm it. <br><br>"It seems the drug dealers have set up major bases of operation in Aqua Anu. Just this morning a police station was bombed and despite increases in military force, we may be in this one for a while. Had it not been for the events last month making national news, we could have continued the smaller scale, quieter war, but the public wants change now."<br><br>"And with rumors of high ranking officials taking drug money, I cannot blame them." the President responded. "Speaking of rumors, has Coltarin or Haishan moved onto the recently collapsed nation of Istegium yet?"<br><br>"Nothing official, we have been observing Coltarin troops and naval movements since the first collapse but so far things have remained quiet." This time it was Primary Admiral Jesus Consuelo who responded, unlike Canarias, he spoke straightforward and with the same seriousness as the President. <br>"I have dispatched two Marine divisions to Booth Island, they will be passing Istegium on route and can be deployed to gain some ground if we need to take it in a hurry. I hope, however, we can reach a political end to secure a supply zone on the continent."<br><br>"As do I."<br><br>The President took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. Politically the annexation of Belmotin would go smoothly, sure some terrorist attacks occur there every so often, but hopefully the offer of citizenship from Parliament would fall on gracious ears. <br><br>Now to the elephant in the room...<br><br>"Final thing Gentlemen, the Empire of Stevid, between them and Imbrinium hundreds of ships are moving into the waters around the south Greal Provence. I must say, between the two. I think they should sort out their trouble, it is not our place to get involved."<br><br>The room was taken aback slightly, out of all the things they expected, they had not believed the President would be as uninvolved as this. <br><br>"Mr. President, if I may, the situation in Stevid is something to keep an eye on, why else would the Empire be building up forces towards the East?"<br><br>"I believe you Generalissimo, however as you can see, there are many nations smaller than us, closer than us that if the Empire felt like being Imperialist about, could make easy targets. We have already recalled a large portion of the fleet to the mainland, if they wanted war they would have to take on both us and Imbrinium, not to mention any other nations that got involved. If they went after former Istegium, they would have to contend with the all of us on this continent. It is something to keep an eye on, but I believe our best course of action is to declare neutrality, and focus our attention on issues closer to home. Mainly the North East, we have Belmotin to handle, drug wars to quell, and negotiate a supply zone on Istegium with parties who believe we have no purpose there. We will observe the Stevid situation for now."<br><br>"Aye Aye Mr. President"</div>

<div class="content">Deep under the capital of Cormond the MOD was buzzing with activity, with tracking of ships and aircraft. With twenty separate war rooms with conference rooms in those and able to take a direct hit from a nuclear weapon, this was an underground city within its self. <br>As the crown, the prime minister, and select members of parliament moved into a war room. As they walked in with their military escort it was alive with members of every branch of the military looking at computers and screens on the walls. The group where escorted into a conference room where the military stood up at attention as the Crown and the rest of the group came in and sat down. <br>As everyone in the room took their seat a General stood up to brief everyone on the current operations and crisis. <br><br>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen as many already know one our ships rammed a Stevid destroyer that got too close to out convoy. The HMS Crowell is on it&#8217;s to a safe area to take on repairs. The Stevid Empire is busy putting more ships into the fray, as you can see here on these thermal scans there are heat plumes in these ships and twelve hours later those ships were gone. Our forces in East Mordent have also picked up a Stevid fleet operating north of Morrdh with this threat to our northern operations and possible threat to East Mordent. All over the middle and eastern region Stevid forces have stepped up their presents.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Our forces are like this we have four fleets operating in the middle region with another four fleets deployed to New Empire, we also have a Longsword fleet and no less than six fleets in the middle and eastern region. We have called in the naval reserves to support more regional task forces so far we have activated RTF six and seven along with doubled the ocean patrol vessels around our coast. Our submarine forces have doubled the number of SSK and Nuke boats.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Our air force is deployed a fourth of its forces to their secondary bases to include bombers and fighters, also up too half of our air assets are ready to deploy to their secondary and third bases. We have command and control and support aircraft in the air twenty four hours now along with a nationwide CAP.&#8221;<br><br>The crown sat back in his chair and lit a cigar; he looked round at the intelligence in front of him and on the screens around him. <br>Then the king leaned up and spoke. &#8220;You gentlemen are where you are because I trust you to make the right call, just like my father did me when I was where you are now. Have any of you have a solid plan?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes sir we have a plan we looked at battle plans from our war games and talked about what we should do and this is what we have. First off we need to beef up our forces on East Mordent with the second army headquarters being moved to East Mordent. The plan is to reinforce the 22nd Cavalry division with the following divisions:<br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Show Spoiler" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';      this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide Spoiler'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show Spoiler'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">15th Air Cavalry division<br>3rd Armored division <br>87th heavy infantry division<br>8th Air mobile division (SOC)<br>7th light infantry division <br>20th armored division</div></div></div><br><br>And three separate brigades a SAS brigade, Sky guard brigade, and a medium range missile brigade.

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Morrdun, Morrdh</span><br><br>Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, or the COBRA Room as it was more commonly called, was the meeting room typically used for meetings of the Morridane Cabinet usually in the event of some crisis or another and thus kept ready for use 24 hours a day and 7 seven days a week should it be required. With ongoing developments linked to the current Stevidian-Imbrinium tensions, now was one of those that the COBRA Room was needed. Rather than the full 20 odd members of the Morridane Cabinet, only a handful of Cabinet members that formed a much smaller 'Defence Cabinet' were in attendance. It was in essence a war cabinet, the use of 'defence' in the title was due to the Commonwealth's already declared state of neutrality and an expectation that it would be dragged into a pending conflict.<br><br>As ever the meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Edmund Vermillion, who began the meeting by simply asking. "Well then gentlemen, how prepared are we?"<br><br>"If I may start." Said Richard Clark, the Home Secretary. "The Civil Defence Corps has been brought up to a state of readiness and blackout regulations have been rolled out across the eastern coastline, course this will be extended across the rest of the Commonwealth once the fighting start. Likewise the infrastructure is being put into place to evacuate women and children from eastern areas, <span style="font-style: italic">especially</span> from West Mordent."<br><br>"Touching on that last part." Mike Morgan, the Secretary of State for Transport, spoke next. "We have an Auxiliary fleet of merchant vessels thanks in no small part to the Reserve Assets Act, plus merchant shipping is being directed to our northern and western ports. We're also looking at what improvements can be made to the rail network serving those ports."<br><br>"Course the Navy has started operating a convoy system." Added Nathan Hay, the Secretary of State for Defence. "This is in conjunction to increased naval patrols in the Gulf of Mordent and our southern waters. Aside from that the air force has redeployed some Skyguard squadrons to our eastern areas along with a few fighter squadrons. Plus the army has been mobilizing its reserves and deploying units to the eastern areas as well."<br><br>"On the diplomatic front we've already declared our neutrality." Commented the Foreign Secretary Sir Gedney Hill. "Though a formal declaration will be made when the shooting start, chiefly to reinforce the Commonwealth's stance and in accordance with international law."</div>

<div class="content">Northern Eldrich, Stevid&#8217;s most northerly province, was bleak at the bet of times but today more so &#8211; especially on the north coastline. The weather really could not decide whether or not to just be grim or to rain as well. The surf from the sea mixed with the light drizzle and the black threatening sky added to the depressing backdrop. Along the soaked shale beach walked to men, rifles in hand, with full webbing and daysacks on their backs patrolling the coast. Not since the war with the Golden Throne had this practice been exercised but with the gearing for total war with Duke in New Empire and now an emerging threat from the North in the form of Imbrinium, the Territorial Army had been given the sad task of patrolling and keeping visual watch over the skies and sea. Regardless of modern radar and sensors, nothing compared to a decent set of eyeballs.<br><br>Across the grey sea a destroyer and two corvettes were making their way further north on an anti-submarine patrol. This was no longer a rare sight, neither were sighting of whales accidently making their way up rivers because the Navy was so busy pounding the water with acoustic 3D sonar blasts &#8211; enough to drive any animal close to insanity. This had paid off further afield though. A small ASW echelon off west Stevidian South Greal had chased away a possible enemy submarine but had not followed up with actual weapons fire. The seas around Stevid were probably the best defended in the region with the Navy so actively keeping watch. <br><br>The Territorial soldiers continued on their patrol towards one of the renovated concrete bunkers that served as a basic look out post only a mile away. Helping them plod on though was the faintest sound of bagpipes in the distance coming from the post &#8211; above it flew the Stevidian flag, violently being tossed around by the ocean wind. Grim indeed.<br><br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br>Three naval Sabre fast jets soared over the pristine ocean just underneath the clouds. They belonged to the Sanctus Mare class super carrier HMS Impervious operating from the battle fleet stationed south east of Morrdh, the same fleet that had been deployed as a counter measure to any Duke or Lyran shipping during the war with New Empire and also the Tehver Crisis. News had spread across the Stevidian military of a massive build up of Imbrinium naval assets. Surprise was the only thing that couple with this news, all this over a redeployment of military hardware to an under defended Imperial territory.<br><br>In response the Holy Empire decided to take a firmer but less aggressive approach to dealing with Imbrinium. These three Sabres were part of that plan of diplomatic action. The Defiler Class command and control cruiser operating from out of the battlefleet some seventy miles away had been busy trying to intercept enemy transmissions, and decode any that it did mange capture. Work was intensive and difficult, but luck, intelligence from other sources and Stevid satellite espionage (that was over a week away from having enough satellites in the right place to build and complete picture) had allowed several transmissions to be partially heard and cross referenced with images and other information from Army intelligence back in Morrdh. It had appeared that of all the task forces deployed by Imbrinium, several were heading in the direction of Stevid and South Greal but one in particular was within the immediate strike range of this task force. Further images had confirmed that the task force lacked a carrier, or at least it did not have one attached to it at this time. Regardless a collection of Imbrinium ships, ranging from corvette to cruiser, had been identified and was now being intercepted by these three carrier strike jets.<br><br>Intercept was achieved within 20 minutes but it was not lost on the pilots that a direct approach would be viewed as openly hostile. The jets computers registered radar waves washing over them, they had been detected and could possibly be within weapons range. The jets began an indirect approach flying in close formation as they circled the task force from afar. Slowly they closed the circle to a more intimate distance and then proceeded to fly towards the task force head on. The reason being that the jets presented themselves but remained less threatening because of the head on approach. To fly towards amidships would present a large target area to hit, where as from the bow head-on, the target area was narrow and less obvious&#8230; at least that was the idea anyway.<br><br>The jets, still in formation, accelerated to max power and closed the distance considerably. The computers panicked as weapons lock from the Imbrinium task force had been identified but the planes remained straight and true, committed to going as fast as possible. Assuming that the largest of the vessels in the fleet was the commanding vessel, the jets headed for that vessel &#8211; still accelerating. In an act typical of Stevidian sabre-rattling, though not seen since the Cold War with Kanami, the jets passed over the top of the cruiser by only two hundred metres and broke the sound barrier. Three huge sonic booms bombarded the fleet below as the jets turned and began circling &#8211; but the weapons lock remained and yet the planes continued to goad.<br><br>Slinking silently along the calm ocean about a kilometre away was a small box floating on the surface. Inside were optic cameras and sensors as well as a delicate communications array built on top. The technology was hardened and robust but small enough to remain undetected. Below the water line the object was bigger and housed more sophisticated batteries and optical lenses that could search the surrounding surface and underwater area with infrared beams and a small selection of other optics. Also under the waterline were small propellers for movement and fins for stabilisation. This box was had an optical firewire cable encased in steel that travelled deeper underwater, tethered to a Stevidian Astute Class submarine. The little box allowed the occupants within to view the scenario unfolding on the surface with high-definition quality, the ability to electronically identify the class of vessels and transmit this to the Defiler command ship. The ability to zoom<br><br>Stevid&#8217;s submarine force was probably the most secretive in the world; the government had only ever admitted that the Stevidian navy operated submarines. The buck stopped there. Classes, types, numbers, locations, service records, actions in times of war, none had ever been mentioned in parliament or in public. Even Stevidian allies got the vaguest information relating to Stevidian subs, usually that they were operating in theatre; this theatre could involve half an ocean. This most guarded secret meant it would always be difficult for foreign states to make grandeurs claims of a sinking or even that they had intelligence on their whereabouts. But any self respecting Admiral in the Imbrinium Royal Navy would know that Stevidian submarines were out there watching them. He would never know how many or where they were &#8211; but he knew they would be out there acting almost independently of Stevid itself, and that they would be a constant threat throughout this little cold war.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br>In response to the massive naval build up from Imbrinium, one Splinter Fleet and three independent task forces were activated to wartime readiness. A splinter fleet was basically half a battle fleet and could contain up to four task forces each with two carriers each. Each splinter fleet was led by an Inquisition Class dreadnought (significantly smaller than a super dreadnought and build to replace all the command battleship goliaths the Empire used to use) as flagship but not a central hub of command. The command structure was decentralised to protect the fleet&#8217;s combat efficiency so that task force operated under their own chain of command but answered to direct orders from the flagship when required.<br><br>The splinter fleets task forces were scattered around the Stevidian Isles bar one that was just north of Liberated America. The fleets would semi converge (as in be within thirty miles of one another) and head north to combat to combat the build up of Imbrinium naval units that were making their own journeys south.<br><br>Of the three independent task forces, one would make towards the north east of Independent Hitmen and patrol Stevidian shipping lanes north east of her ally. The two other task forces would make for the west coast f Stevidian South Greal to deter further enemy moves along that side of the continent. <br><br>With the move of the whole 5th Fleet to Stevidian South Greal, naval logistics were stretched relatively thin so a massive naval mobilisation coupled with a planned move of over 500 ships was straining naval planning and war mobilisation. Ideally another entire fleet would be ordered to full combat readiness and prepped to sail north in dribs and drabs. This could no longer be achieved. It was then publically announced that the 1st Fleet was to be placed on &#8216;Permanent Standby&#8217; and that vessels under the bracket of the 1st Fleet were to begin training their crews for the possibility of war within a few weeks &#8211; commanders were immediately begin to liaise with their chain of command about potential moves and combat drills. It sounded serious but around 40% of the 1st Fleet, including the super dreadnought HMS Imperious and 60% of the carrier force, were in harbour at basic combat readiness and unable to do much more within the proper logistics at sea. The other 60% were already part of the on going patrols around the Stevidian Isles and local territories of Guffingford and Liberated America and were ready for war.<br><br>It was propaganda if anything and once the 5th Fleet&#8217;s move to South Greal was complete then the 1st Fleet would mobilise. Until then, enough was done in Stevid to make it look like mobilisation of the fleet to combat readiness through vehicle movements to harbours was on going. In truth little was being done.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Ord, Southern Morrdh</span><br><br>Southern Command, or to give it it's proper name of Commonwealth Forces Combined HQ South, was the Tri-Service command bunker located in the city of Ord on the Ordic Peninsula. Its area of operations included the southern approaches to the Straits of Mordent (a task shared with Commonwealth Forces Mordent) and the southern Morridane coastline stretching from the capital of Morrdun down to the Peninsula, then the Gulf of Morrdh coast to the Killian border where the Border Defence Force took over. All told it was almost three thousand miles of coastline and the surrounding waters that the Command had responsibility for, including the strategically important southern approaches to the Straits. With the diverting of merchant traffic to Morrdh's northern ports, there was now only naval ships and the odd fishing trawler that now sailed through these southern waters.<br><br>Traditionally Southern Command had concerned itself with the movements of naval vessels of the Commonwealth's neighbour of the Imperial Republic of Hailandkill, whilst warships were typically easy to spot Killian submarines were another matter entirely and so anti-submarine patrols was a major part of Southern Command's operations. With rising tensions between Immbrinium and Stevid, Southern Command had focused its attention to the Straits of Mordent to either submarines of either side from attempting to sneak through what were Morridane territorial waters in order to gain an advantage on the other side. Dozens of ships and patrol aircraft were devoted to the task, all overseen and co-ordinated by the joint Naval/Air Staff at Southern Command with the help of charts and intelligence reports.<br><br>With the Stevidian Royal Navy actively blasting the seas with sonar, it made things a little difficult for Morridane ASW efforts as each reading had to be double checked to see if it was a return of a Morridane sonar or an echo of a Stevidian sonar. These difficulties aside, Southern Command was aided greatly by the efforts of Naval Intelligence in at least attempting to keep track of naval activity in the vast ocean south-east of Morrdh. An intelligence report would come in of a possible unknown in the Southern Approaches, a brief check of the positions of Morridane naval units would be made before deciding whether or not to investigate. If it couldn't be confirmed then a patrol aircraft would be directed to the contact's last reported position and given a search grid to operate in, the aircraft would conduct its hunt with sonar buoys until pinpointed the contact. Then a mock attack would be made against the contact with 10lb practice bombs designed to harmlessly explode on hitting the water, usually the contact got the impression that the Morridanes meant business and altered course.</div>

<div class="content">All around the crown there was a sense of urgency with it seemed war was in the air and getting closer like a storm on the horizon. The DSS and royal guards have had the royal family running drills to the citadel a huge old castle built into a mountain about 75 miles from the capital, the work on the citadel started in the 50&#8217;s and still was under construction in some parts. The complex was huge with almost 95% of the complex under the ground and mountain. With 25 miles around the citadel cut off from the rest of the world expect the workers and personal who worked there on month long tours, there was rail into and out, an airport and subway tunnels to bring in and out personal. The complex could take multiple nuclear hits do to being so far underground. After over fifty years of digging and expanding no one in the public knows how big it is. The emergency drills where setup to keep the crown up a running after a war.<br><br>In space at least at the moment the crown had the upper hand with a satellite network rival others in the region. With back up satellites ready to deploy, along with an impressive satellite network for spying there is also a network in place just to destroy satellites and attack targets on the surface. <br><br>At sea all ships had been ordered to use passive systems and go on the hunt with the Stevid navy. This means they will shadow and confront Stevid naval forces anywhere in the region. There now were some 175 subs of all types operating in and around all Stevid ports and ships to include civilian shipping. There was at least one sub commander which decided to push the ROE and try to hide itself with in a Stevid fleet this SSK will try to find any weakness in their sub defense.<br> <br>The RIN and RIAF bombers where now flying to predetermine points call recall point where they would circle for a point of time and return to base, there was a support and or a bomber taking off and landing every 3 to 5 minutes. Support aircraft where AWACS and intelligence gathering aircraft, sea and ship hunters and fueling aircraft.<br> <br>Carrier based aircraft where flying around every NAF and RTFs in the region. These aircraft where flying CAP, intelligence gathering, AWACS, sub hunting. <br><br>There where drills and training on the mainland also bring all forces up to full speed in case this becomes a shooting war. The cyber warfare group where poking around on the internet looking at every back door it could find one. The cyber warfare group where busy attacking the network on all front both civilian and military nets.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conberth Harbour<br>Northern Stevidian Coastal Port<br>Eldrich Province</span></span><br><br>About 4 miles out to sea, one could see a Stevidian <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=154" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Reef Class</a> frigate silently snaking around the entrance routes into Conberth Harbour. Surrounded by submarine nets, there were three entrances into the harbour and one ship and her ASW helicopter could defend them all.<br><br>A small crowd had gathered on a pier some two miles further up the coast to see what was usually a rare sight. Royal Navy ships never usually exercised this close to the harbour and, despite the secretive nature of the Stevidian submarine service; it was known that at least two hunter killer submarines operated out of the base. Conberth was one of the smallest naval outposts in Eldrich province but had seen an upscale in military activity with the increased activity in the north from &#8234;Imbrinium. The crowd consisted of mainly fishers and military enthusiasts keen to get a good look at the warship to identify it. The more &#8220;clued up&#8221; individuals would recognise the vessel at the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Hotspur</span> &#8211; 3 years old with service in the far north dealing with anti-piracy around Kurona plus a nine-month tour conducting raids against narcotic and weapon traders on the Holy Panooly mainland &#8211; now tasked to the 4th Fleet, 2nd Battlefleet, 28th Echelon to provide homeland ASW security to friendly harbour and port facilities.<br><br>At irregular times over several hours, the King Arthur ASW helicopter would conduct a furtherance sonar buoy sweep to add more to the frigate&#8217;s sonar picture. The MRS-7000 multi-functional sonar mounted to the hull of the ship provided a 3-dimensional false colour picture of the depths below her, the hydrophones on the sonar bulge numbered 17,000 and her information processors handled enough data to project a crystal clear picture of the ocean that worked in tandem with the helicopters own buoy equipped with nearly 12,000 hydrophones and emitted three active pulses every 4 seconds. Enough to uncover almost any submarine in the known world, failing that, discrepancies in data could allow warfare operators to make educated guess on the potential whereabouts of enemy submarine and allow active homing torpedoes or charges do the rest.<br><br>The crowd became excited and intrigued as the helicopter dropped its buoy and severed the tether and allowed it to float on the spot (a lesson learned from the last regional war during the conflict with the Merkar Republic) and begun to swoop away as the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Hotspur</span> started to change her bearings sharply. Attention increased and more people arrived at the pier as the frigate sounded several &#8216;whooping&#8217; klaxon blasts as she warned civilian shipping and people along the coast of her intent to attack. The King Arthur ASW helo raced low towards the surface and dropped two torpedoes that penetrated the surface and within seconds detonated underwater causing a huge explosion sending a massive plume of water into the air. The helicopter swooped around and dropped several charge into the sea over a sparse area that cause a series of small but intense explosions, one in particular causing a deafening boom and a small fiery secondary explosion. Afterwards the helicopter circled in a wide arc and dropped two more buoys into the water. The frigate had retreated further away to catch any escaping submarines. It was then that a deafening roar was heard from the sky as an RAF <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=92" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Scorpion</a> multi-role attacker flew low overhead. It dropped four unguided bombs on the extremities of the submarine fence line that was under the water that cause four similar detonations to the first torpedoes. <br><br>Within an hour, all was calm again and the frigate continued its patrol.<br><br><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span><br><br><br>Though not officially at war, naval shots had already been fired with Stevid the main culprit. Enemy submarine insertions along the Stevidian coasts were seen as an outrageous breach of sovereign waters. The MRS 7000 sonar was probably one of the best sonars in the world and allowed almost unique identifiers of enemy submarines &#8211; or at least non-allied ones. Blue on blue contact was slim at this stage. Five separate occasions similar to Conberth has occurred close to Stevid. All had been confirmed submarine contacts and all had been attacked with a disproportionate amount of force to ensure a kill or at the very least reassure a concerned public.<br><br>Nearly twenty enemy sonar contacts were reported in the Otium Aqua Sea between Stevidian Guffingford and Rubet Island. Four of these had been engaged, seven had been engaged but then lost &#8211; there others were simply lost before an effective hunt could commence.<br><br>Only three submarine contacts had been made against fleets &#8211; these contacts two had been pounced upon but without lethal force, instead an effort was made to drive away suspect submarines at sea because it was more difficult to distinguish between friend and foe.<br><br>The Royal Navy was well adapted to anti-submarine warfare and continued to pound the seas with sonar. The actual sonar belts that were positioned in the north Otium Aqua from Eldrich to Liberated America and then to Guffingford, and the south from Stevid to Guffingford were regularly pinging submarines that were not being careful enough. A detailed picture was emerging that &#8234;Imbrinium was unable or unwilling to confront the Royal Navy conventionally with surface warships and was instead attempting to utilise their submarine force to harass the Stevidian blue and brown water navy. It was estimated that more than 100 enemy submarines were in operational range of the Stevidian mainland &#8211; unknown whether if any were nuclear armed.<br><br>The surface vessel continued to operate as per normal at an extended state of wartime readiness. The 5th Fleet was still relocating to Stevidian South Greal but the move was expected to finish within two weeks &#8211; give or take a vessel here or there. Surface vessels and the secretive submarine service were now closely monitoring Imbrinium naval movement. Stevidian submarines were deliberately being less intrusive around Imb mainland so as not to arouse too much suspicion &#8211; key naval ports were under surveillance but from afar using high-definition optical cameras. While no official numbers would ever be released, less then 20 submarines had penetrated enemy territorial waters.<br><br>Type 66 Dweller Class anti-satellite vessels were operating deep within fleets and at anchor in allied ports dotted around the region and others further afield on the globe. A comprehensive map of potential enemy targets was being compiled and being tracked &#8211; intelligence reports from an Army Intelligence Corps company in Morrdh and that from details gathered from a Damocles satellite uplink centre that was captured in Duko south of New Empire had provided nothing in the way of intelligence for Damocles but much in the way of foreign satellites in orbit. If anything it helped filter out discrepancies and confirm which satellites belonged to Imbrinium and which ones did not.<br><br>The Stevidian satellite network was slowly catching up with the enemy&#8217;s, although satellite numbers remained stretched and in high demand and would take another week before a clear and accurate picture of the battle space from orbit could be complied. The satellites were focusing away from the sea; the Royal Navy had deployed most the submarines to shadow enemy fleet movements in the blue water areas. Focus from orbit was on land based targets &#8211; watching the build up of land units in strategic areas, but of greater importance was ground based airfields and communication centres, radar stations and launch pads, potential intelligence gather stations and ballistic missile silos and mobile platforms.<br><br>The RAF were active too, mimicking the enemy&#8217;s own AWACs and JSTAR flights not through tit for tat but as standard operating procedures dictated. Information was critical for Stevid, more than sabre rattling. The main SIGINT stations RAF Brambly Farm, RAF Kings Landing and GCHQ were working in overdrive downloading and disseminating data at a rate not seen since the last regional war. All intelligence gather on enemy place and naval movements would be routed through these stations and several others including Defiler Class command and control cruisers and Hanover Class EW/ELINT cruisers operating nearer enemy positions so contact reports can be send almost instantaneously to the correct recipients.<br><br>Enemy transmissions were of course being monitored &#8211; but cracking encryption was some GCHQ in Stevidian Capita would have to worry about. Where enemy transmissions were discovered, suspected or otherwise assumed to be occurring, measures were undertaken by Hanover and Defiler Class naval vessels, and RAF RC-135W Airseeker aircraft, to jam and/or intercept those transmissions from reaching space or directly to point-to-point locations on the surface of the Earth.<br><br>The Holy Empire was slower and more cautious in terms of conventional military hardware and committing assets to counter Imbrinium. But the information management and collection, encryption and dissemination of data, intelligence reports and comm channels were, at this point, second to none&#8230;</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Morrdun, Morrdh</span><br><br>Sir Gedney Hill, the Morridane Foreign Secretary, was reading through some of the latest intelligence reports when the intercom on his desk buzzed. Pushing the button, he simply said. "Yes?"<br><br>"Sir." Replied the voice of Sir Gedney's personal secretary. "The Imbinium and Stevidian ambassadors are here to see you."<br><br>"Very well, send them in please." Sir Gedney replied before closing the file he was reading and placing it in one of the desk's drawers as the two ambassadors walked in, both of whom had been summoned by Sir Gedney and were keeping a respectful distance from one another. Everything seemed calm and polite, though Sir Gedney suspected that it was more to do with diplomatic protocol rather than anything else. "Ah gentlemen, please be seated."<br><br>"The Commonwealth enjoys good relations with both of your respected countries, good relations that we hope will continue for a good many years to come. However recent tensions between the two of you have put the Commonwealth in bit of an awkward position, hence why I have called both of you here today to ensure that the Commonwealth's position on the matter is made clear and understood by all concerned."<br><br>"As previously declared the Commonwealth wishes and will remain a neutral party in any conflict between your two countries, we have no desire to get involved. To this end we will be adopting measures to ensure our neutrality such as closing the Trans-Mordent border, closing the Straits of Mordent to all non-Commonwealth vessels and intercept any aircraft that enters our airspace to escort it back out again."<br><br>"From you two the Commonwealth requires Imbrinium shipping to take the northern route round to Larkmouth on our northern coast, likewise we ask that Stevidian shipping take the western route round past Spectare and up past the Imperial Republic of Hailandkill to dock in our western port of Ramarck. We don't want drunken brawls breaking out between the sailors of your two nations. And finally we request that you cease all intelligence operations that either of you currently have going within the Commonwealth. I trust you find this fair?"</div>

<div class="content">The news of the loss of five SSKs and their crews hit hard the Crown wanted answers and the prime minster wanted a response and the so did the military powers at be. The war plans that had been sat on for months where now authorized. And within hours EAMs where being sent out to all of the commands and the military might or the IAF stormed into life. The border with Morrdh was closed on Mordent.<br> <br>The naval assault fleets went into passive operations to track Stevid forces; the first to be attack was to be the Stevid fleet off of Morrdh shores and had been tracking fleet operations. At airbases inside eastern mordent B-12 took off loaded with hellion&#8217;s cruise missiles, these hundred bombers where being escorted by over a hundred and fifty fighters. <br><br>The first wave of attacks would be on fleets and naval bases and ports next would be airfields and military supply base around the region. <br><br>All around the region&#8217;s oceans and seas the Imbrinium&#8217;s naval subs both SSKs, and SSNs, where ordered by EAMs to engage all military targets within their range.<br> <br>Bomber forces already in the air on their show of force patrols were given their mission orders to fly passed there recall stations and proceed to their targets, these EAMs where sent out to all bombers in the skies, which meant the ones on their way back to their bases where turned around and headed to refuel to make their targets. While all of these bombers both naval B-12 and air force&#8217;s B-90 carried at least one or two nuclear weapons but the orders where only to engage with conventional weapons only. <br>With the plan against starting, an ongoing operation was also given a go ahead. Operations Savage Dragon and Savage Fury where now go, Savage dragon was the day and night bombing of insurgent positions mapped out by UAVs and Specops teams on the ground. There was also a new target was the Damocles satellite uplink, to blackout movements of satellites. Operation Savage Fury was an invasion of former Duke south of the Stevid DMV lines. Also landing troops in the northern zone to support operations ongoing in the north, some 300,000 marines where fixing to land to conduct operations against insurgence in both the north and south of Morrdh and Stevid forces. <br><br>In space counter space operations where now underway, the plan was to blind the Stevid satellites, and gain space dominance over the region. Killer satellites where moving into position to take out all Stevid&#8217;s satellites. Along with space commands killer satellites the air force and naval forces where doing their part in taking out satellites with missiles. <br><br>With thousands of missiles and aircraft headed for bases, ships and ports the war had started even though this wasn&#8217;t the first shots it would be the largest attack thus far.<br><br>OOC: I will be away on training till the 11th of july I will try to post even if I have to use my phone to do it, just wanted to let everyone know.</div>

<div class="content">With escalation would come retribution, though that would have to wait until the full assessment of what damage had been caused was complete. Regardless, Stevidian response to attack was prompt. Incredibly though, Stevidian and Imbrinium (Crown) ambassadors had been summoned by Morrdh and during the discussions there, the Crown had launched an attack.<br><br>There was little doubt it was in response to the Stevid destroying Crown submarines, despite the fact those submarines had violated Imperial waters. That was irrelevant now, the reckless escalation of hostilities by Imbrinium would be remembered regardless of the finial outcome of war. Seeing as discussions on neutrality and the Morridane position on allowing foreign military units in its territory was still under discussion, the Military Intelligence company in Morrdh continued working until it was order to prepare for redeployment. The company, together with SIGINT monitoring stations in Stevid, space and those on <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=72" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Defiler</a> command cruisers, saw a noticeable spike in encrypted transmissions in Imbrinium. Data streams and other encoded transmissions were again detected within the battle space and the ocean between the Holy Empire and the Crown. It was clear a major shift in tactics and strategy had come about. Despite this assumption, nothing was concrete as Imbrinium high-level transmission encryptions had not been broken and were unlikely to be broken &#8211; direct orders to troops/aircraft/ships would remain unknown to the Empire, but it was glaringly obvious that the rise in transmissions was probably the prelude to a large attack, be it en mass in one place or region wide.<br><br>The INT reports were acted on immediately and wartime readiness across the Stevidian military, both at home and abroad, shifted from Extended to Immediate. The three fortress cities Stevid Capita, Keele and Milton went into high alert state, the ring wall and subsequent weapon systems were activated, satellite airfields and defensive structures were also activated and placed on permanent standby. The city anti-ballistic missile systems point defence flak, laser and missile batteries were activated. Short of actually closing the corridors into the cities themselves, the cities were now in lock down. The major port facilities and military bases in the north were placed on maximum alert and local populations were told to expect an attack. The south experienced less of a jump in alert readiness but the industrial heartlands in the south and in the central wastelands were told to expect minor attacks. But the relative distance from Imbrinium made an attack there nearly impossible. The biggest scenes of mobilisation were in Liberated America and north Stevid &#8211; closest places to Imbrinium that belonged to the Empire. In particular airfields were placed on immediate action and readiness to move at moments notice. Pilots sat in their planes ready launch straight up the airfield the moment a non-friendly blip on the radar appeared or an Observation Corps member spotted or heard something he didn&#8217;t like.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">HMS Leviathan<br><a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=133" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Inquisition Class Dreadnought</a><br>Flagship, 2nd Fleet, 3rd Battlefleet, 2nd Splinter Fleet<br>Seconded to Task Force 551 as Flagship &#8211; Swift Licentia </span></span><br><br>As per Stevidian naval fleet construction, the main battle fleet was broken down into two splinter fleets comprised of between 2 and 5 taskforces. The 3rd Battlefleet had been dispatched north the previous year in defence of New Licentia as part of the Tehver Affair and had been stationed south west of Morrdh following a cooling of tensions. The fleet moved further southwest following rhetoric from both Imbrinium and the Empire and now the 2nd Splinter Fleet was positioned 300km further north of the 1st Splinter Fleet which was now steaming west to eliminate any and all Crown shipping detected. However the Crown had known the approximate positions of the fleet through satellite intelligence, despite the difficulties involved in finding ships at sea even with satellites, enough intel had come the Crown&#8217;s way to attack the fleet. Within the fleet were Dweller Class satellite destroyers; it was no secret that the Crown was spying from above, few satellites hung quite so obviously above the fleet in such a low orbit. There were dozens up there, all Crown, all staring down upon a small chunk of the region &#8211; the order was given to fire upon the satellites in orbit to prevent other naval assets at sea becoming quite so easily compromised. The Splinter Fleet had three ASAT cruisers and all chose their independent targets, over the course of 30 minutes, hundreds of missiles had been launched, the missiles included those that were kinetic strike, proximity and also ball bearing dispensers. Actual kills were not the objective, even if slightly damaged, a satellite was next to useless and would require replacement. Fragmentation in zero gravity would be hurling at thousands of metres per second, enough to put a satellite out of action indefinitely.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">HMS Leviathan</span> was the 3rd Battlefleet&#8217;s flagship of the 2nd Splinter Fleet. She was part of a decentralised command structure within the Splinter Fleet&#8217;s five task forces. Each task force maintained a level of independence but overall command resided with the Splinter Fleet Flagship. Admiral Tinkner was the flag officer aboard the dreadnought. A veteran of the last regional war and experienced in operations against Kanami in both Hanover Wars, he knew how to fight large naval engagements. But his skills would be soon put to the test.<br><br>The carrier groups within the Splinter Fleet had continuous CAP missions but also had carrier based AWACS operating at the limit of their range, further boosting radar and detection coverage. Support from RAF JSTAR and AWACS also contributed to early detection ranges. It was this increased detection range that alerted Admiral Tinker to the oncoming attacks. Staggered waves of missiles were approaching the fleet at high speed and extreme range &#8211; the naval bombers would not be far behind and neither would their escort. Being reasonably close to Crown territory allowed for a large escort presence too.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Sound the general alarm.&#8221;</span> He said calmly as his radar operator confirmed the attack and the bearing to the fleet. The operations room was bathed in red lighting and was only pierced by the steel blue LCD screens of the computer consoles. Tinker grabbed the intercom speaker that had immediate links to all ships in the fleet.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;It is now confirmed the fleet is under missile attack. We believe the missiles to be live and from inbound Imbrinium aircraft. All hands to action stations, the fleet is now at condition red. All hands to action stations.&#8221;</span><br><br>Less than a minute passed and signals from all ships in the splinter fleet acknowledged they were at condition red.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Officer of the watch!&#8221;</span> Tinker started, his training and experience starting to kick in. An aging commodore and a youngish looking captain greeted him. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;The initial AAW picket force ring is about 20 km out from the main task forces. The missiles, and potentially the aircraft, are coming from north by north west. I want two Lemartes Class destroyers and a Reef Class frigate to break and move north-by-north west and engage the missiles and aircraft as soon as possible; eliminating what they can before the missiles reach the main force. If the enemy have any sense they will try and destroy the carriers &#8211; their survivability is paramount.<br>A Winchester light cruiser will reinforce the picket ring &#8211; the fleet will need additional CELLDAR transmitters closer to where the action will first happen. We need to keep the picture detailed and up-to-date.If we keep the information of the battle space concurrent and make sure we adapt to it, we&#8217;ll win this.&#8221;</span><br><br>There were nods of approval from both officers; to one side a scribe was transmitting the orders over coded bandwidth to ships and units that the orders applied to. This also included messages to the cloud computing data network, otherwise known as FORCEnet, keeping the entire navy (and by extension the military) up to date with the current happenings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Those three ships will have air support from HMS Zaneta (<a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=126" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Sanctus Mare</a> super carrier). All carrier air wings are to prepare for launch. Seventy aircraft must remain close to the fleet for continued close support. A further sixty are to engage the missiles and break up the attack. Those aircraft, depending on the over all destruction of missiles, are to probe forward and attack the bombers and escorting fighters. Twenty fighters are to stagger their attack and formation over several kilometres and flank west. The small numbers and flights of about five aircraft or less may not be noticed as soon as the main bulk force of our fighters approaching head on. It keeps them on their toes.&#8221;</span><br><br>Both nations had enough intelligence on one another to know that military capabilities of each other. It was no secret that Imbrinium would probably use Hellion anti-ship cruise missiles. Probably one of the most potent and deadly cruise missiles on the market, it was expensive but had high-survivability rates and high kill ratios once actually in the terminal phase. It&#8217;s sophisticated AI complicated matters but could ultimately be used as a way of distracting the missiles further. As a cruise missile is limited in size and has to accommodate much in just over 5m of space. The goal of the initial Stevidian counter attack was to get the missiles to expend much of their counter measures before meeting the main Stevidian naval force. Anti-air pressure from <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=122" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Lemartes Class</a> destroyers (reputed to be the one of the best anti-air destroyers in the world) coupled with the AAW capabilities of the <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=154" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Reef Class</a> (both classes sported PAAMS multi-function tracking and engaging air defence systems), together with a massed attack from <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=116" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">XF-25c/d</a> carrier based Hawker air superiority fighters. <br><br>The missiles had been detected 300km by SAMPSON and CELLDAR radars, but confirmation had only been ascertained about five minutes later. The fleet had about 20 minutes to react and would do so since most of the planes were up in the air already. The point of contact would be about 15km out from the picket line &#8211; some 40 kilometres away from the main force. With initial action forcing the &#8216;clever&#8217; missiles to evade attack and increase their survivability, the speed of the missiles would reduce, their counter measures would be expended (only on some however) and overall flight time would increase. Battle space control allowed quick detection of the missiles although pin pointing the aircraft was proving more difficult but approximate locations were given to the 20 Hawkers flanking west.<br><br>In total 38 fighters were in the air to engage the missiles head on before moving to attack the aircraft. 15 remained in the air over the fleet while a further 15 remained on the carriers ready to launch within 5 minutes of hellions breaking through the counter attack force and the picket line. 20 fighters were flanking west while 20 remained on standby in the air inbound from the other Splinter fleet to react in case additional support was needed.<br><br>Just as planned, the numerous dots on the <span style="font-style: italic">Leviathan&#8217;s</span> radar met 40km away from the main force. Hellion missile terminal velocity was around 546mph &#8211; just over two and a half minutes&#8217; flight time. This would be extended however with the ensuing action. With CELLDAR and SAMPSON working in tandem and the FORCEnet removing irrelevant and redundant data, the enemy hellions were detected at some 100km away. Aster-30 missiles from the three ships dispatched to engage the missiles ahead of the picket line were launched in staggered stages to forces the hellions to continually evade. The fuse was fragmentation did not require a kinetic strike to kill or damage. Damaging would be sufficient to kill missiles later on in the engagement; the Asters travelled in excess of Mach 4 and were more than fast enough to meet the enemy missiles and reengage as necessary covering the distance in less than 30 seconds. Both the Lemartes Classes and the Reef Class were both armed with the latest in anti-air laser technology but also with the ILMS cannons. ILMS was conventional in the sense it was similar to Goalkeeper and Phalanx systems but its AI and computer interface was also one of the best in the world. It allowed human interaction to make sense of sensor confusion and used computer processors to calculate where to shoot based on the weather, atmospherics, speed, distance and potential manoeuvrability of the target &#8211; in this case the Hellion&#8217;s stats were known throughout the world. <br><br>The lasers fired first; charged blue energy firing with extreme accuracy would incapacitate some missiles before engagement with the Asters. The radar screens on all the ships showed the beauty of the Hellion&#8217;s AI as the missiles danced around avoiding both missile and laser, some continued on as if nothing was happening, but they would meet another staggered launch of Asters, the closer they came they were met with the short ranged Aster-15s before flying over the ships in a hail of artillery fire from the ILMS cannons and main guns. The air was peppered with explosions and flares and the hellions were defeated, or as the evaded and made their way forward towards the picket line and main fleet. The gravitas of the situation became apparent to the AI and the computer network Imbrinium used. The engagement was spread over a small 10km area and the missiles easily registered the three naval culprits and several missiles AI adjudged to engage the ships. Stevidian FORCEnet relayed this threat to the ILMS and missiles that now begun to defend the ships rather than to directly attack missiles. Within minutes, a Lemartes Class was crippled and listing, the Reef Class frigate was sinking and the other Lemartes was burning almost out of control but was still able to fire her point defence cannons. <br><br>In the air, the 38 Hawkers continued to harass the Hellion and managed to deplete their numbers further before heading north in intercept the enemy aircraft flights.<br><br>The picket line in the north only had four vessels that encountered Hellions that had now dispersed over a very wide angle of attack. The numbers were further cut down using the same tactics of before; some of these vessels had launched Aster-30 missiles in the initial engagement, now the whole fleet was involved. The hellions were now beginning to choose their targets but not entirely through choice. The AI would realise survivability was be getting lower against a coordinated air defence like this and was now punishing Stevidian ships for fighting too hard. Minus the ships already attacked, several escorts and four cruisers were destroyed. The 15 aircraft on carriers launched to support the other 15 in the air and began to harass the missiles that were now in the terminal stage and beginning to ignore most threats. To that end Hellion kills went up but so did shipping losses. An <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=165" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Emperor Class</a> battleship was struck and damaged, as two other cruisers. Four more escorts were destroyed along with a Dweller ASAT cruiser. Among the more high profile losses, an Audacious light fleet carrier was damaged and was listing to port, though not sinking; a <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=112" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Hanover Class</a> EW cruiser was destroyed but require nearly ten strikes before she exploded in a huge spectacle of destruction. The flagship was hit as well but the jamming meant the missile struck the superstructure and the armour meant the damage was only superficial. The smash damage meant several machine guns and five ILMS cannons refused to fire- the shock waves meant that the fire control system was scrambled for several minutes so targets for the ILMS were input manually for the stand alone computers to track until full fire control was restored. The biggest loss was the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Arturus</span>, a <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Stevid_MoD/index.php?showtopic=142" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Crusader Class</a> battle cruiser. She suffered a similar fate to the EW cruiser and took twenty protracted hellion strikes before she succumbed to damage and blew her magazines killing 900 of her 1,140 crew.<br><br>Post attack procedures had been rehearsed since leaving berthing in Morrdh and so recovery of personnel and equipment was efficient and professional. The picket line was established and focus and air but also submarine attack resumed to &#8216;pre-action stations&#8217; levels. In total 13 ships had been destroyed with around 7 crippled and declared &#8216;out of action&#8217;. While most of the losses had been escort vessels like Reef and Starling Class frigates, a handful of treasured Lemartes Class destroyers had been crippled with one destroyed. The psychological effects of losing the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Arturus</span> could not be judged at this stage but the spectacles seen by crews with the destruction of EW cruiser <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Equivocate</span> and battle cruiser <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Arturus</span> would scar the memories of the sailors that day.<br><br>The Splinter Fleet was crippled and its AA defence compromised and lacking escorts and would require full rotation with ships from the other Splinter Fleet and support from stand alone task forces further south to boost numbers. The other fleet moved north in support of the stricken fleet while a single task force broke away to continue surface and submarine naval interdiction.<br><br>As planned, the planes involved in the initial attack did not expend all their missiles and staggered themselves into three small waves as they moved to intercept the enemy bombers. The 20 reserve planes from the other splinter fleet would provide cover for the fleet as the counter-attack commenced.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br>The main Stevidian response would come from elsewhere. The lack of Stevidian satellites in the correct position meant that though a few losses had been sustained, satellite coverage had not yet been compromised &#8211; besides Stevidian allied satellites through the Delian League would be used if all else failed. Satellites that had been in the correct position had not been focusing on enemy ship or air movements (these could be figured out conventionally in time), they had been focusing on enemy ground installations.<br><br>These images and grid references were transmitted over several hours using heavily encrypted burst transmissions to prevent detection or arousing suspicion. The recipients were the twenty or so submarines now close to shores of Imbrinium. Silently they had sat for days, all twenty dotted around the entire coastline many hundreds of miles apart from one another and at different depths. All oblivious to the locations of each other. All with the set targets and missions &#8211; but all 20 waiting for the small burst transmission of just a handful of bytes of data. So small it wouldn&#8217;t be noticed, and so complexly encrypted it was pointless deciphering; and even if it were it would read similar to:<br><br><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>*Cruz* *n-nuk* G/R 9733 x 2771 Ex G/R (9733) 1332 x (2771) 7726 &#8211; God Save the King, God Save the Empire.</code></dd></dl><br><br>Cruise missiles only, no nukes and a Stevidian Military eight-figure GPS grid reference with an addition fine grain grid reference for accurate targeting of up to 10 metres.<br><br>The twenty submarines were given their targets &#8211; some would share as only five had been pinpointed for immediate attack and destruction. <br>The high-priority targets were two rocket launch pads and the accompanying space centres that had been identified in the past through media, news intelligence and now satellite imagery of launching satellites potentially for military use and communicating with them. <br>Two military air force bases that were observed to have high concentration of &#8216;golf balls&#8217; and a network of dishes believed to be centres for controlling and communicating with satellites, military units, and the transfer of data to Crown units throughout the world. Of course it was hard to prove but the two bases may have been engaged in SIGINT and ELINT operations that have the ability to intercept conventional cellular tele-communications and/or intercepting tele-communication satellites.<br>The final target was a satellite-tracking centre. Immaterial if it was civilian or not, the hardware was obvious as the amount of dishes pointing up at the sky was plain to see and it was logical to assume the military had a stake in the installation or better yet to assume it was indeed military. Lightweight military vehicles could be seen in the imagery but it could not be confirmed if the site was 100% military. Enough evidence was there to justify a strike believing it to be a genuine military target.<br><br>The attacks would occur at the dead of night and the submarines were charged with the destruction of these sites with AGM-129 stealth cruise missiles and the domestically produced AGM-715c Eliminator stealth cruise missiles. Surprise would be the advantage here and the cruise missiles would use the terrain to their advantage to avoid radar as well as surprise. Imbrinium had a formidable military but the Kingdom was not a militarised nation, an attack from missiles from all directions would confuse most layered anti-air defence assuming the Crown had one at all for combatting terrain hugging missiles. The submarines would then retreat slowly and quietly to predetermined depths and coordinates to avoid detection as best they could. A communication and camera tethers were retracted and nothing was left behind betraying the whereabouts of the subs - they would all be blissfully unaware if the missile strikes were successful or not...</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Ord, Southern Morrdh</span><br><br>The gathered naval officer stood up as Vice Admiral George Holbrook, Flag Officer Submarines of the Royal Morridane Navy, entered the room and walked to the podium followed by some of his staff officers. Upon reaching the podium he addressed the room. "At ease gentlemen."<br><br>"Before I begin I would like to stress that this briefing is classified. Your mission is dangerous enough without having to worry about security leaks, especially since leaks of another kind will be of greater concern to you." Holbrook announced once the officers were seated, raising a few chuckles at his joke. "Now, lets get down to business."<br><br>"As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_class_submarine" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Oberon class</a> captains you have been selected to conduct surveillance operations outside of certain Imbrinium and Stevidian ports, only you and your XOs will be privy to this information." Continued Holbrook. "You will be required to lie off submerged outside of your selected target during the hours of daylight, then use the cover of darkness to operate at snorkel depth to recharge your batteries. Though I must stress that you are to remain in international waters at all time and if threatened you are to leave the target area at once, you are under strict orders not to engage in combat even if fired upon."<br><br>"Your mission is to simply observe Imbrinium and Stevidian naval assets and not to partake in any hostile action, though each of your submarines will carry a minimum operational load of torpedoes in case of an encounter with a Killian sub. So unless there are any questions I'll hand you over to Captain Benlin to brief you on the position of minefields in the Straits of Mordent...."</div>

<div class="content">It was still the first nights of the war and it still hadn&#8217;t sent in with most in the kingdom. But with anything a time of change was upon the crown and its people. At various radar and naval intelligence post along with the crown high command center the naval sonar rings around the kingdom had picked up intermittent tracks coming from different points all around the kingdom nothing to track to get a point but that would change, a patrol aircraft reported missiles being launch from a sub in the north west of the country. The alert went out and the air defense command and fighters and support aircraft scrambled, the interlocked intergraded air defense came in to play, radars that were turned off due to the phased array OTH radars where the primary system to pick-up incoming aircraft and missiles, this told the commanders that there where stealth missiles inbound. The counter-stealth radars where switched on and started with their scanning the skies, even with the CSRs going along with other radar stations it was hard to track the inbound missiles. The crown in the capital city was rushed to their helicopters and flown out of the city to their bug out points. <br><br>The P-8 patrol aircraft the witnessed the launch turned and dropped sonar buoys and tracked the sub for a few minutes before launching four MK50 torpedoes. <br><br>Within twenty minutes of the launch the first of the missiles hit their targets; the first was the Imbrinium Space agency&#8217;s major launch platforms for both military and civilian missiles. The fires where massive with fuel stocks exploding and the command center taking a direct hit causing a number of civilian dead and wounded. The second and third impacts where two large air force bases housing two of the air force&#8217;s ELINT and SIGINT satellite farms. The attacked damaged up to forty percent of the bases sensors and causing a few deaths due to the command and control is a few miles away and underground. The final target wasn&#8217;t a military target but had military personal helping civilian scientists in the Imbrinium space agency&#8217;s ASTRO-PULSE, program, basically looking for ET on other planets. The complex was not armored and the base was a totaled loss with over a hundreds dead and hundreds wounded.<br><br>With the damage reports where streaming in and command wanted answers how did this happen. Plans for a new operation where in the works when the attack happened and the commanders and the crown gave the plan a go ahead. The larger operation had many just as many equal sizeable operations. The first operation was &#8220;Namtar&#8221; the operation was aimed to cut off all contact with Stevid main and Southern Greal. The bulk of the force will come from four NAF and RTFs along with SSNs, and SSKs. Not only against shipping but against aircraft as well. Operation Kali now in the works is the 18th NAF to invade a small island north of Eslovakia and south of Malgrave, the plan is to invade the island to use its airport and two deepwater ports. Other plans where in the works but they where weeks and months off to get naval and military units in play.</div>

<div class="content">As the sun broke over the horizon and as the locals where going about their morning activities, listening to the local T.V. and radio stations till they when they went dead everyone was trying to change channels and then a strange crackle came over their sets and then a voice came over telling everyone to stay in their homes and stay off the roads.<br><br>At an old mid-size airport the first of the of the V-22s hovered over the tarmac and ropes dropped out and marines bailing out of the back and started to take control of the airport. The next was V-22s and CH-53s started to land and off load troops. The marines unloaded their MUTS and mortar systems and started setup defenses. <br><br>On the coast line at a deserted beach AAVs and ELVs moved out of the water and onto the beach some started down the beach road to the nearest town. Others setup a beach front command post with a beach-master. The beach-master controlled the influx of vehicles and supplies coming onto the beach. <br><br>The first of the floating docks made their way to the beach loaded with support vehicles and armor. These docks will stretch out to the deep water break and will have Ro/Ro ships will unload their cargo and vehicles. <br><br>At the airport the overall command post was now up and running even with equipment still flying in. A V-22 landed and the marine commanders walked and across the tarmac into the command post to find the TOC busy with activity, commanders talking to their units and others telling units where they are needed and where to head to next.<br><br>&#8220;Where are we with the operation?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Well sir we have units moving up along the coast here (points and map)and we own the airport here, we have heliborne and ground units moving through the village here (points again at the map) to secure the port so we can unload everything.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Very well make sure the units headed through the village take care to not to destroy or harm anybody or thing.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Aye sir&#8221;<br><br>The commanders walked out to the first set of land rovers and moved to the village to see the port taken. So far no shots had been fired so far and the marine commanders wanted to keep it that way.</div>

<div class="content">As the Imbrinium troops advanced into the village they were greeted with empty streets, shuttered doors and twitching curtains as their vehicles rolled along. Upon reaching the village square they were confronted by an administrative building or town hall with a large white flag hanging out one of the upper windows. At the building's entrance stood a small group of men, local official and some armed men who were presumably their bodyguards. The leader of the group, a mayor or local lord, cautiously moved towards the Imbrinium soldiers and called out. "We wish to speak to your commander!"<br><br><hr><br><br>Imbrinium's moves hadn't gone unnoticed, especially as Commonwealth Intelligence Section 6 (or CI6 given its more common name) had been tasked with keeping tabs on the combatants involved in the Stevidian-Imbrinium Conflict. Section 5, or CI5, had been tasked with making sure that Commonwealth soil wasn't used by either side to their advantage in the conflict. Though the Imbrinium landings on the isle near Malgrave took even Commonwealth Intelligence by surprised and sparked fears of a much larger war. In response a scout team of the Royal Reconnaissance Service, the Commonwealth's body responsible for gathering intelligence and supporting military forces in a reconnaissance role, was hastily despatched to the island in order to give the Commonwealth eyes and boots on the ground.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Government Sector - Epping</span></span><br><br>Robert Liepzig sighed heavily, running his hands through his hair as the large computer screen behind him began to show a slideshow of recent maps of an island invaded by Imbrinium overlaid with recent intelligence reports on military movements, albeit rather rushed ones. Upon hearing of the situation the government had immediately formed together the Rapid Government Response Taskforce (RGRT) to think of solutions to the growing crisis and the Defence Minister had been tasked with providing members of the Cabinet vital information concerning the military side of the equation.<br><br>"The Kingdom of Imbrium has deployed approximately two fleets including a Longsword with appropriate defensive and logistical support, this force has already engaged and started occupying the island of Arastonia and military intelligence currently estimates that approximately two or three divisions remain to be deployed. We are in an extremely dire situation Prime Minister as these forces can be turned upon the mainland at a moments notice and inflict massive civilian and military casualties. I recommend that we place the Territorial Defence Force on high alert alongside all branches of the Royal Malgravean Armed Forces. The Royal Navy and Air Force have reassured me that we can deploy around fifty to sixty percent of our forces within hours with emergency personnel from the Research Colony arriving in two weeks" the Defence Minister announced a rather tired look on his face beginning to continue before his comments were interrupted by the Foreign Minister.<br><br>"I don't think we have time to await forces from our colony Robert. A country has deployed a large invasion force in our territorial waters without our consent and frankly the rather aggressive manner in which they conduct themselves as me deeply concerned Prime Minister. We must contact our regional and international friends immediately and request assistance in the form of equipment and logistics. Morrdh and Mokstana are nations that could be contacted and I believe we provided Morrdh assistance in the aftermath of an earthquake quite some time ago, so they at least must be willing to provide some form of defensive aid to help us out."<br><br>A singular clap from the Deputy Prime Minister stopped the reply from the Defence Minister, and the argument that was waiting to happen. Quinn pointing to the Prime Minister when attention was bought her way. "Robert? Inform the Royal Navy that they must deploy immediately, the Royal Air-Force must be scrambled and ready to respond to any aggression whilst the Territorial Defence Force and Army must coordinate together to provide extra manpower to logistical facilities and fortifications near the coast. Thomas? Inform Morddh and Mokstana that we would require military assistance to ensure that we do not become the target of foreign aggression, also contact this Kingdom and inform them that they must withdraw from the island." Prime Minister Berry said, smiling in appreciation when she received a tidal wave of nods and approvals.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Curie Naval Base - Oslo</span></span><br><br>Rear Admiral Polis glanced out at the ocean before him as he began to read ever increasing reports about the situation in front of him. The Malgravean naval officer had been tasked with establishing visual contact with a foreign naval fleet that was current invading a rather insignificant island with an incredibly over the top force that included a Longsword. In order to carry out this task the Rear Admiral had been given control of four carrier groups with six more planned to arrive alongside Grand Admiral Inigo Campioni himself. It seemed to him that the Royal Navy was frankly crapping itself and gathered together whatever it could as quickly as possible in order to ensure that the Navy could at least put on a decent showing if the Imbrium navy decided to pay more attention to the Malgravean mainland.<br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Fleet" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">4 x <a href="http://nswiki.net/index.php?title=Commonwealth_class_aircraft_carrier" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Commonwealth Aircraft Carriers</a><br>16 x <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_class_destroyer" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Epping Class Destroyer</a><br>8 x <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astute-class_submarine" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Narwarhl Attack Submarine</a><br>16 x <a href="http://nswiki.net/index.php?title=Broadsword_Class_Frigate" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Broadsword Fleet Defence Ship</a> (8 x Liepzig class AAW frigate, 8 xWizna class ASuW frigate,</div></div></div><br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><div align="center">Official Communique of United Kingdom of Malgrave</div><br><br><hr><span style="font-weight: bold">To:</span> Regional and International Friends.<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Subject:</span> Assistance<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Encryption:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #00BF00">None</span></span><br><hr><br><br>The Kingdom of has stationed an invasion fleet in Malgravean territorial waters that includes a Longsword type naval vessel and approximately two or three divisions according to our latest military intelligence reports.

They'd observed the fleet of people approaching the Malgravean waters for some time, and it wouldn't take a genius to work out that their esteemed ScienceBuddies would be displeased by the actions of what was currently described as 'GBFO-Fleet' on the lower decks. It had taken half the expected time to reach full readiness, which looked good, as he'd been bringing things up and about before the official order came in from Crown Fleet Foxtrot's Command.<br><br>The Small Kouralian 'fleet' was a Task Group - now technically a 'Battle Group' as it was preparing for the possibility of a fight, so not exactly the most impressive gathering of ships on the planet. Commanded from the Temeraire, there were two Crookfur-built Amphibious Assault Ships and the Gay-Class RKNV Kurjak, and a small swarm of Frigates accompanying the RKNV Temeraire as the Escort Contingent. Meanwhile, below the waves the RKNV Artful was skulking about as fleet protection, to discourage anyone from picking too much of a fight with it. The fleet carried the Fifth Royal Marine Brigade Expeditionary Force, all ready to try and land on this island, or assist in a defence of Malgrave in whatever way seemed correct by their new Regional bosses. "Aye, we're staying on this heading lads." The Admiral said as she leaned back in her chair. "I expect we'll get a little message from the Malgraveans shortly."</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">HMS Valiant</span><br><br>Rear Admiral Polish was rather alarmed to hear that the Imbrinium naval fleet had moved within 50 kilometers of the mainland, immediately relaying these reports to central command in Epping who immediately responded by putting coastal defence batteries on full alert and the scrambling two squadrons of multi role and attack aircraft. On top of this Polis had ordered the local deployment of an EM-2D AWAC for redundancy purposes and to keep an additional eye on the movements of Imbrinium's aircraft. <br><br>A series of small annoying beeps alerted the radar technician to the proximity of allied vessels. "Sir. We've detected the arrival of allied vessels from the Freethinker Commonwealth and the Royal Union of Kouralia." the Seaman said swivelling on his chair to face the room, the rest of the sailors ignoring his acts and focusing on the task of organising the deployment of a round of fighter aircraft that would shortly be sent to provide additional cover to the fleet, although it currently received this from fleet and land based anti-aircraft and ship missiles.<br><br>"Kouralia and the Freethinkers? It seems this alliance is living up to this worth" Polis said stepping forward to look at the screen "Although saying that they've not really sent much. We'll send them a message regardless and inform them of the situation." The Malgravean Officer had looked into the longsword quite some time ago and knew of what damage it could deal against opponents with the proper back up.<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0">To: Royal Kouralian Naval Vessel<br>From: Rear Admiral Polis, HMS Valiant<br>CC: Freethinkers Commonwealth Naval Vessel<br>Subject: Naval Assistance<br>Encryption: High.<br><br>Comrades,<br><br>As you may notice we are in dire need of assistance. The Kingdom of Imbrinium has dispatched a vast naval fleet that includes a Longsword and the capability to hold two or three divisions. They claim to be using this force to occupy a nearby island for use in another military operation however we are quite concerned that this fleet could be wielded against the mainland at anytime something that would result in heavy civilian and military casualties and considering the fact that the country they are targeting are located some distance away from us it sparks some immediate doubt over these earlier claims. Our current objective is to mainly observe this fleet as it begins to occupy the island and respond with appropriate and deadly force only if any forceful movement against ourselves or military and civilian infrastructure on the mainland is detected.</blockquote><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Government Sector - Epping</span></span><br><br>Thomas Plume slowly rubbed his eyes in an attempt to remove the sleep that had formed, the world was an incredibly hectic place and it seemed the role of Foreign Minister was endless, although he dreaded to think of what the workload would be without the army of staffers he had at his disposal. It seems the situation involving Imbrinium had expanded with the RGRT being called into action once more to figure out a response and this time Thomas was selected to speak first<br><br>"We've received word from the Kingdom of Imbrinium on top of the personal communique you received from the Royal Union of Kouralia. They claim to be invading the island of Arastonia for potential use against another country they are at war with called S..." Thomas, a slight red blush creeping up his cheeks as he was forced to check his notes before continuing "Ah yes! Some country called Stevid. I'll allow Robert to talk about them and the military situation now Prime MInister" <br><br>"It seems the Royal Union of Kouralia and the Freethinker Commonwealth has redirected nearby naval assets to assist, as part of the defence agreement of the Charter of Crowns and the individual defence agreement we currently have with the Kouralian government." The Defence Minister grinning wildly when a staffer passed him a small tablet device, the room turning silent as the Minister quickly sped through what seemed to be a brief summary of a much larger report.<br><br>"I can now also report on the status of deployed military assets, Prime Minister on a service by service basis. Firstly I am glad to report that the Royal Air Force continues to be on a state of quick readiness although it has also scrambled two squadrons of multi-role and attack aircraft and has moved additional personnel into improving the efficiency and defence of ground air-defence batteries and supporting facilities. As you know the Royal Navy has already deployed four carrier groups and is currently moving six more into position. Recently however the Navy has expanded its operations and started submarine patrols of major ports on the coast and has set-up anti-torpedo nets. On top of this units from the Army, Territorial Defence Force and Royal Marines have been coordinating defence efforts. Coastal fortifications, logistical, communication and vital civilian infrastructure including existing checkpoints have been reinforced with additional units. In addition units from the Royal Marines and additional units from the Royal Navy have been placed on high alert in case an operation to seize parts of Arastonia is planned." <br><br>Once more the Deputy Prime Minister clapped sharply bringing the full attention of the room to the Prime Minister, despite her small nature the Prime Minister was not to be underestimated and the act of clapping was more to do with Quinn's need to instil some fear amongst the Ministry then anything else. Rachel herself looked quite calm especially compared to the junior ministers in the room. "Thomas. We simply cannot allow foreigners to position aggressive fleet outside our national waters and accept the excuse that are using it as a staging point for another conflict especially when they plan to use a peaceful island nation for this purpose. It is unacceptable and I hope you push that point across." Rachel said, the Foreign Minister quickly leaving the room with a team of aides, quickly turning to the Defence Minister "Robert. You've done extremely well in positioning our forces defensively. I think we should also inform the paratroopers that they might be needed and inform all branches that provocation of Imbrinium forces in anyway shape or form will not be tolerated. I also want a plan drawn up to liberate the island of Arastonia." <br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><hr><span style="font-weight: bold">To:</span> Queen Alyx Campbell of the Royal Union of Kouralia<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Subject:</span> Assistance<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Encryption:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">None</span></span><br><hr><br><br>Honourable friend,<br><br>Our latest intelligence reports that the Kingdom of Imbrinium has stationed its vast fleet approximately fifty kilometers from our mainland and they possess large amounts of firepower that if used against us pose a massive threat to our civilian and military infrastructure.

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>It was the early hours and under the cover of darkness when the otherwise calm waters were broken by a surfacing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_class_submarine" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Oberon Class</a> submarine just off the coast of Arastonia. The vessel had sailed from New Garrack with an eight man Royal Reconnaissance Service scout team and their canoes on board, its task was simply to drop off the scouts who would then use their canoes to get ashore so that the submarine didn't remain on station too long. Once the scout had taken to their canoes and started paddling towards the shore the submarine would then dive and make for its home port back in New Garrack.<br><br>After being dropped off the scout team was effectively on its own, though their canoes and the cover of darkness would allow them to get ashore largely unnoticed so that they could carry out their mission. Their task was simple; locate the Imbrinium forces, observe their movements and then report back on this via the use of radiosets. It was a typical and standard mission for the RRS, plus a vital one which gave the Commonwealth eyes on the ground to let it build up a better intelligence picture. Though each man was armed and carried a L1A1 SLR, the standard battle rifle of the Morridane Armed Forces, mainly to hunt game to supplement their rations and to defend themselves if and when needed to do so.<br><br><hr><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">West Mordent</span><br><br>When the initial hostilities broke out between Imbrinium and Stevid, the Commonwealth took measures to ensure it neutrality and closed the Trans-Mordent Border that separated West Mordent from Imbrinium controlled East Mordent. This had been declared along with provisions for Imbrinium and Stevidian to dock at different Commonwealth ports to avoid brawls between the ships' crews. The Commonwealth had also been bolstering its eastern defences, the ones directly bordering the Imbrinium-Stevidian warzone. As well as deploying additional Skyguard batteries along the coast, the Gulf of Mordent had been closed to non-Commonwealth shipping and mined as Royal Morridane Navy stepped up patrols.<br><br>West Mordent itself had also seen its defences stiffened with further Skyguard batteries and reinforcements for the Morridane military forces already stationed there. The civilian population, mostly women and children, was evacuated to the mainland as the Morridane Army effectively took over West Mordent and started turning it into a fortress. A line of trenches and fortifications was built along the Morridane side of the border, complete with tank traps, barb wire and even minefields. Concrete pillboxes and dugouts were also constructed along with ammo dumps and pits for artillery guns as sappers laboured to fortify the border. It was all built with defences in depth as the Commonwealth adopted a defensive posture, determined to maintain a state of armed neutrality.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">102 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>The night was tranquil as the tower of the Artful surfaced, like a black prehistoric monster sent from hell to destroy all and sundry. A few miles to the South the Kouralian Amphibious Battlegroup was steaming on in its vague path. A few minutes later a small craft was on its way with the Kouralian Royal Marine team in it. The sub slowly lowered back into the water, and within moments it was as if nothing at all had happened. <br><br>The small craft was matte black, and in it was a full section of the Royal Marines Commandos - who'd transferred from the main contingent when it had become clear that a sub of men might be helpful. They were of the Light Coy. of the Kouralian BEF's Light Battalion, Marines rather than the 'Silverfin Guards' shock troops who were running about in APCs and IFVs - or would be. Of the Light Company, they wore the full set of gear - webbing, helmet, tablet compies, the SA12 'Rifle, Bullpup, Cased, 7.7x43mm', Anemosian Pistols: the works. In their Camouflage gear the lads kept on their way toward the island - as sneaky as their commando training required, so they'd hopefully be able to get some good intel from boots on the ground.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>Two miles to the north, shortly after the sub had descended, the crew was still in a state of high alert - so no stupid mucking about would give away the location of the Marines Commando Section. Thus, the Submarine was in an almost calming state of bustling quiet as every crewman did their jobs, when suddenly there was a huge grinding noise. The boat shook horrifically, as the noise echoed like a dying whale - or some similarly poetic shit. Thrown to the floor, the Captain struggled to his feet, gazing around in a bleary-eyed confusion. "Status report! What the fuck was that?!"<br><br><blockquote style="background-image:none; margin-left:0"><div align="center"><img src="http://nswiki.net/images/Kouralian_Naval_Flag.png" alt="Image"><br><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempestas de ferro in sal</span></span></div><hr><span style="font-weight: bold">Sent:</span> RAdm.

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>The Morridane diesel-electric submarine was running silent towards the open sea after dropping off the RRS scout team, there was a barely suppressed air of celebration at successfully dropping off the scouts without being spotted. Though the sub would continue to run silent until it reached deeper waters and the sub's captain was happy that they could proceed at normal cruise speeds. Already he was on the boat's intercom. "Chief? Prepare to Group Up."<br><br>Group Up, a command to configure the boat's electrical motors for high speed running when dive. Getting the engine room crew ready to do this meant they could quickly put on speed if needed like when a hostile vessel decided to attack them. The captain was just about to have a quick look through the periscope to see what surface traffic was around then the sonar operator all but screamed. "<span style="font-style: italic">Contact dead ahead! BRACE FER IMPACT!</span>"<br><br>An almighty clanged reverberated throughout the boat, followed by a grinding noise as the submarine lurched to one side and almost threw everyone off their feet. Water sprayed out from dozens of places as shouts and cries of alarm echoed throughout the boat as it drifted out of control, acting quickly the captain barked out orders. "<span style="font-style: italic">Blow all tanks! Get us upstairs FAST!</span>"<br><br>Compressed air was blown into the various ballast tanks to displace the water and thus make the submarine raise upwards the surface, there was no doubt that they had collided with something and the only way to see what damage was done was to quickly surface. If the hull was compromised then surfacing meant they could get the crew off and abandon ship if need be. Of course, that was presuming they could surface...</div>
