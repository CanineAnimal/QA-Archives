<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>"Stabilise!" The Captain bellowed again, staggering up as the crew became a blur of activity. "Status report, what was that and why didn't we know about it?" He asked as the submarine shifted rapidly aside and then almost stopped, in an attempt to keep the hull secure. "Status, hmm?"<br><br>"Sorry sir!" The SONAR technician said, "Something hit us, it wasn't an explosion, we must have impacted against something!" Once he'd said that, the damage report came in - the hull was damaged but not fully breached in three places including the tower. Not <span style="font-style: italic">truly</span> dangerous, but not worth skulking about and keeping with the flotilla - they'd have to head to Malgrave and a port there to get it all checked out properly. Fortunately it had been a very low speed collision.<br><br>"Fine, no harm done..." The Captain muttered, "We'll surface for the moment and see if we hit anyone in the vicinity. We couldn't have hit a surface vessel so it has to be a sub... oh..." He paused, his mouth open in shock, "We're so fucked if it was a Freestian ship..."</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Charcharodon</span><br><br>"Well, I guess it kind of counts as a fleet." Captain Anna Camberwell stared across the water to the 'Armed Replenishment Oiler' <span style="font-style: italic">FMA Strength of Purpose </span>, a bulky support ship that, for all its mass, seemed to have little trouble bumping along with the Centaur class destroyer she was supplying. Several cables, some fuel, some electrical power or wiring (to coordinate speed at such close range) and lines for goods and people criss crossed the space. In truth, the nuclear powered destroyer needed little fuel save for her aviation attachment and the huge quantities of industrial lubricant a vessel as large and complex as theirs went through. <br><br>"An oiler, a destroyer and three semi-here submarines. Brilliant. I can hear the enemy quaking already." The XO, a women some ten years older and greyer than Anna, a Commander Rowena Argus, stood next to her, choosing a navy overcoat over the tropical white uniform. The weather was cold to both of them, but the Fargoni captain was at least used to it, despite some years on the Mainland. The two of them looked at each other with mutual confidence as below dozens of men battled the wind to get a full stores load over as soon as possible.<br><br>The order to integrate with the Kouralian effort was understand if not entirely welcome. At least the Malgravians and the Kouralians had some Freestian designed (and therefore electronically equipped) vessels of their own, which meant fire control and sensor integration had been (or would be, in the case of the locals) a case of flicking a switch and entering a code. The Kouralians <span style="font-style: italic">Centaurs</span>, including the nearly famous 'Temeraire', added to confidence, at least. A slowly evolving picture of the 'enemy' emerged, the Longsword was not considered the threat its owners might have wanted, but submarines and destroyers were another matter. Whatever could shoot, after all, was always a threat, and Camberwell sent a new request every few hours for whatever spare forces could be sent.<br><br>What she had been given was an operation name, "In Silver Clad", a 'task force' name, Force KZ, and a breakdown of her vessels, the submarines <span style="font-style: italic">Usurper</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Visigoth</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Weapon</span>, three acoustically neutral hunter killers, her own Centaur destroyer, and the <span style="font-style: italic">Strength of Purpose</span>, which was armed to corvette standard and carried a flight of ASW helicopters to boot. They were sailing towards the Kouralian force at a gentle, if overtaking speed, the latter' attached amphibs allowing the Freestians to overhaul. The submarines of course were doing their own thing, and there was a standard comms blackout for now. It was expected the Imbrinium knew they were there, even if they had yet to understand fully what that meant. <br><br>Hopefully Navarre would send more ships. If not, well, the Kouralians were considered useful. In truth Camberwell and Argus expected things to die down quickly. It was a shame there was no wood to touch.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>The Morridane submarine surfaced without too much difficulty, situations like these was something that the crew was constantly trained and drilled for. After surfacing the hatches were quickly opened and life rafts made ready. just in case they had to abandon the boat in a hurry, whilst the chief engineer and some of his ratings checked to see what damage they had inflicted. They certainly had collided with something on the boat's starboard side, there was scrape marks on the hull and the starboard forward plane had been severely damaged meaning they'd have to stay on the surface as they transited back to port.<br><br>There was a shout of alarm as bubbles broke the surface nearby as another submarine started to rise out of the water, causing a series of shouted orders and a scramble for the boat's weapon locker.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">100 Miles South-East of Malgrave</span><br><br>"We've breached the waterline, sir!" The First Officer called out as the sub rose... <span style="font-style: italic">Slightly</span> majestically from the waves not too far from the Morridane sub. "And... There's another contact on the surface, twenty meters to the East!" The Captain looked around hurriedly as the First Officer turned and bellowed for the Armoury to be opened.<br><br>"No." The Captain said calmly, repeating it more loudly, "No man is to engage until we are fired upon. I will not have this boat start the war." He sighed, "Fetch the rifles, let's hail them." As he said so, Captain Attero reached for the microphone, speaking when the communications officer gave him the nod. "Unknown Contact, this is Captain Attero of the Royal Kouralian Naval Vessel Artful. Identify if you would be so kind: over."</div>

<div class="content">The confirmed launch of the missiles against mainland Imbrinium was music to the ears of the Stevidian military chiefs of staff. The strikes against their signals and intelligence networks would prove to be decisive in the coming months as reliance on any edge over the enemy would prove vital. The destruction of the space centres was seen throughout Stevid as a major victory against Imbrinium space assets on the ground; it was known that they could still put more satellites in orbits, but planned launches at all sites would be thrown out of the window with the damage and or destruction of the launch pads and their facilities. <br>What was potentially damaging was the strike on a planetary monitoring station. While the attack was justified in regards to military communications traffic and obvious military vehicles parked around the facility, intelligence failed to mention the amount of civilian staff and equipment housed there. All could potentially be used for military purposes but the fact remained it was civilian.<br><br>This war was not like the one in New Empire when Stevid fought the Dukes &#8211; as defined by Duke&#8217;s military first policy and that every man women and child was classed as a soldier, every human being in Duke was deemed a valid target&#8230; not here and now. Regardless of Imbrinium belligerence, Stevidian candour and the distrust towards each other, innocent civilians caught up in the cross fire of two nations&#8217; politics were not targets.<br><br>The rules and conventions of war would apply, officers would have to account for their actions, and the Prime Minister would do his bit to calm the coming storm both at home and abroad. The Stevidian government sent a hand written and signed letter to the Kingdom of Imbrinium apologising for the attack on a civilian establishment, outlying justifications for the strike and admitting the wrong decision was made. It further stated that this was not a letter for peace and that the attack on the Stevidian Navy and the Empire&#8217;s ports would be met with harsh consequences. Nevertheless, the attack on civilians was despicable and at the very least an apology was needed &#8211; though it would be little comfort to the families.<br><br>On matters less peace, the Holy Empire&#8217;s second strike would come while the iron was still hot to put further pressure on enemy satellite networking. Type-66 Dweller Class ASAT naval vessels deployed north west of Independent Hitmen launched a little over twenty missiles at enemy satellites in orbit. Judging from the distance from the planet these were both probably military and civilian communications satellites &#8211; actual spy satellites (what ones that had been identified) were not targeted.<br><br>In the North near he Imbrinium mainland the submarine force that had fired the missiles had slinked away silently into he black depths&#8230; bar two. Enemy coastal patrols had struck lucky and had been relatively close to the launch points to spend a few hour hunting and eventually striking home with torpedoes. The losses were noted four hours after launch when the submarines failed to send a transponder signal to the Admiralty. The others continued to lurk deep within Imbrinium and international waters doing what they could to avoid detection.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">* * *</span></div></span><br><br>The early weeks of the war had proven inconclusive though the Holy Empire had clearly struck a heavy-handed blow against Imbrinium military infrastructure, the Kingdom had managed to cripple half of a major battle fleet not far from Morrdh. Other early engagements between the two navies were more tit-for-tat. Where Kingdom ships were attacked and destroyed or damaged they would retaliate in kind but the Holy Empire was deliberate in its tactics to avoid decisive battle in the open seas where it would bare little in the way of tactical advantage. Battle fleets versus battle fleets or carrier battle groups versus each other would amount to a substantial loss of life and expensive equipment that neither side could avoid to lose this early on in the war while operating in the ocean between both homeland nation states.<br><br>However the movements of the Kingdom of Imbrinium did not go unnoticed by the Holy Empire. The Empire had the upper hand in terms of the battle space and the strikes on Imbrinium military communications and satellite uplinks had proved useful in achieving this &#8211; but their communications had not been broken or hacked. Nevertheless, the move against the island stretch directly south of Malgrave had been noted though too late to react to it. The enemy fleet had been reported to be huge and it included a super dreadnought of the Longsword Class &#8211; though the 5th Fleet had been redeployed to Stevidian South Greal (the root cause of the current conflict) and was more than capable of tackling this threat. But the presence of such a large enemy vessel had hammered home the point that even though Imbrinium military forces were very far from home, they were here to stay and right on the doorstep of Stevidian territory.<br><br>While Stevid did not stand alone, the Empire as an entity and her ally Independent Hitmen stood with her, the country was standing on the &#8216;same side&#8217; of several nations that had now decided to become involved through this brash action of the Kingdom. Malgrave in particular had become incredibly vocal and had deployed military assets. The old nation of Freethinkers had also made a surprise appearance, one that was welcomed by Stevid who had purchased Centaur-X Class destroyers from them several years ago and still served in the fleet to this day.<br><br>The full agenda of Freethinkers and the agendum of Kouralia in this conflict was yet to full manifest itself to the Stevidian Empire. The Empire chose not to over look these new players and would not focus on them nor become distracted by the growing numbers of nations involved. The invasion of the island by Imbrinium was a huge provocation and one that had to be tackled. The enemy had the early initiative and seized surprise; the initial taking of the large island would not have been difficult &#8211; holding it against the Stevidian war machine that was only a few hundred miles west in Stevidian South Greal would be a very steep challenge. <br><br>The massive move of military assets from Stevid to Stevidian South Greal, as meant to reinforce the eastern frontier of the Empire, would prove its worth. The 5th Fleet&#8217;s move was all but complete having commenced nearly a month prior to the outbreak of hostilities, the increased numbers of Royal Air Force and Stevidian Army numbers and equipment was easier to transport in bulk than the Navy. Stevidian South Greal was prepped for war and would not require much in the way of supplies and/or reinforcements to assault the enemy&#8217;s claim to the island - the territory was more than able to handle itself now.<br><br>26 July would be the beginning of <span style="font-style: italic">Operation Tonitru Malleus</span> [Thunder Hammer]&#8230;<br><br> Over 600 naval vessels, including two Sanguineous Class super dreadnoughts; nearly 80,000 additional troops on top of the original garrison of 10,000 of an armoured division (deployed to defend the territory from Wanderjar) and 70 jets and bombers of the RAF (with a further 70 promised as reinforcements) on top of the original deployment of 100, were now available to strike at Imbrinium and their fledging outpost in Eastern Greater Dienstad. <br><br>In some way shape or form, they would be involved in Op Thunder Hammer.<br>The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force would be key to the subjugation of the island and ending Imbrinium&#8217;s large deployment there.<br><br>The Navy would have to do something it enjoyed avoiding and engage the enemy navy in open decisive battle. The battle fleets would probably clash as smaller fleets but the over all engagement would turn the sea between Stevidian South Greal and Malgrave into a warzone as a seasoned Stevidian Royal Navy would attempt to cripple its enemy counter part in a naval battle not seen since the Second War of Golden Succession. The main effort would come from the super carriers and their battle groups utilising what advantage that had in terms of battle space control and tactical communications. A super dreadnought was to spearhead a southerly flanking move with several carrier task forces towards the invaded island to draw more enemy assets away from the main effort coming from the west. The second super dreadnought was to remain aloof and obvious but away from the vulnerable carriers so as not to act as a beacon to the Stevidian prized assets. Her huge array of missiles would harass enemy shipping from beyond the horizon and present itself as a tempting target; no fewer than two Emperor Class battleships, 10 Lemartes Class destroyers, 6 Reef class frigates and a Hanover Class EW active/passive defence cruiser would heavily escort her.<br><br>Further north, 40% of Stevidian submarine assets in the area east of Stevidian South Greal (rumoured to be around 55 vessels) would actively hunt and destroy fleet replenishment and supply tanks of Imbrinium. The submarines would, for the first time officially, work closely with 4 small light carrier task forces numbering around 20 vessels each (having between one and three Audacious Class light carriers in each task force) in identifying the flags flown by ships and their call signs and ship registrations in an effort to strangle the supplies coming in from Imbrinium. Being so close to Stevidian territory not only meant the Empire could bring slightly more assets to bear but would also mean the enemy were far from home and their supplies. These raids would be ruthlessly carried out by task force and submarine packs alike.<br><br>The elimination of the enemy naval force near Stevidian South Greal, or at least removing it from play as a credible threat to full operations, was of great importance. But likewise was the aerial commitment. Over 300 additional RAF and RAF Auxiliary officers were redeployed to South Greal to increase numbers of available pilots. The reason being would be the near continuous sorties to be flown over enemy positions at sea and on the mainland. Scorpion strike fighters would hound the enemy navy at established weak spots identified by the navy during the seas engagements and would closely with the Naval Fleet Air Arm. Navy jets would focus on strong enemy naval resistance (be it in the air or on the surface) while the RAF would strike softened or vulnerable targets but also be ready to respond in case naval casualties began to spiral out of control.<br><br>30% of RAF Nightwalkers and Hawkers based in Stevidian South Greal would directly support the Royal Navy in providing air cover from missiles and enemy aircraft from both carriers and land. Another 30% would provide escort to bombers and ground attack aircraft that would hammer the island into ashes. Military targets would be struck first, patrol bases, forward operating bases, major camp installations, runways and ports capable of holding and rearming naval vessels. The bid was to strike right at the heart of the enemy&#8217;s HQ and command and control structures. Like any professional Army and Air Force, Imbrinium&#8217;s was probably decentralised to prevent complete loss of C&amp;C resources, but nevertheless the strikes would hopefully wreak havoc with enemy lines of communications and prevent fully coordinated counter-strikes&#8230; or so was the plan. The other 40% of RAF aircraft would be in reserve, replacing lost aircraft, defending Stevidian South Greal, and reacting as reinforcements if needed. Regardless of what was happening in the east, the west of the territory could not be ignored.<br><br>With Independent Hitmen taking a more leading role in defending the Stevidian mainland coastline, 3 larger carrier battle groups numbering a total of nearly 200 ships were to actively patrol the western approaches to Stevidian South Greal and defend it from attack. 10,000 troops and 40 air superiority and strike aircraft were deployed west too in case the attack on the island in the west was ruse to get the Empire to lower its defences to the west of the territory. Further naval patrols of cruisers, missile battleships and light carriers west of New Empire were to interdict and destroy enemy shipping trying to slip south and penetrate the western approaches to South Greal.<br><br>200 aircraft of bombers, air superiority and strike fighters would be fighting in the west together with their Fleet Air Arm brothers numbering in excess of 500 (that being because not all of the 5th Fleet were deployed in the eastern half of the territory). Around the coastline the Royal Navy kept an imposing presence and had most of her amphibious force preparing to take on board helicopters, troops and armour in a bid to eventually evict Imbrinium from the seized island.<br><br>But this was not all; Op Thunder Hammer had a few more tricks up its sleeve. The Holy Empire had been deliberate in not eliminating as many enemy communication satellites as would have been liked my most military strategists (it was what allowed the Royal Navy splinter fleet of the 2nd Fleet to get mauled as badly as it did). Now a serious strike would begin, time had been taken to pin point enemy satellites - now civilian ones were targeted too. Satellite TV, radio as well as known military comms satellites were to be attacked. ASAT Dweller Class cruisers in Stevidian waters, Adaptus Astrates, Liberated America and Stevidian South Greal launched a massive wave of missiles to at least temporarily in capacitate enemy communications as the immediate prelude to the first wave of naval missiles and aircraft to be set against Imbrinium in the east.<br><br>In a final daring move, a move that would most likely doom most, if not all, the Stevidian submarines around Imbrinium, a second cruise missile onslaught was ordered. Again targeting military communication sites from images that had been further analysed after the last strikes. Secondary targets included large naval bases (coastal based and inland) with buildings and infrastructure in a bid to possibly take out commanders and equipment to communicate with ships and satellites. The strikes were staggered and ordered at different times to maximise submarine survivability, but enemy patrol would be more frequent after the first strikes. Only 5 submarines had been order to reinforce those firing and were instructed not to participate in the attack so they too would remain safe. But 5 instead of 20 were no fair replacement.<br><br>An hour after the first missile launches against enemy ships and ground targets on the invaded island, RAF bombers and support aircraft took to the skies and began heading for the enemy island. Tasks include runway catering and, as mentioned before, attacking HQ and C&amp;C centres. Direct attacks on ground formations of armour and troops were not authorised unless they presented a threat to the aircraft.<br><br>War had not been officially declared but Stevid had now made the large and most decisive move yet of the conflict. A move that was bound to shed the blood of thousands.<br><br><br> The Holy Empire was polite in the sense that a cautionary &#8216;heads up&#8217; should be given to parties involved that were not the enemy. Namely Freethinkers, Kouralia and Morrdh &#8211; whose submarines had only recently been detected but only once identified after a minor incident a few hundred miles of Malgrave.<br><br>The message was un-encoded and observable to all that intercepted it.<br><br><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>TO THOSE IT CONCERNS &#8211; WITHIN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES THE SEAS AND SKIES BETWEEN MALGRAVE AND STEVIDIAN SOUTH GREAL WILL BE THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THE LARGEST BATTLES THE REGION HAS SEEN SINCE THE LAST WAR.

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">IHS <span style="font-style: italic">Supermarine</span>, Shade Class Armoured Missile Cruiser<br>The Otium Aqua, 200km West of Stevid</span><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic">Supermarine</span> was part of the IHN 2nd Fleet, based at the Stevidian port of Sunderland, and was currently attached as an escort to the <span style="font-style: italic">Silverthorne</span> Carrier Battle Group patrolling to the north of the IHN's assigned sector of the Otium Aqua.<br><br>The Armoured Missile Cruiser buffetted against the ten foot squalls so prevalent in the Otium Aqua at any time of year. The cruiser shook again as another wave hit the bow, sending water splashing onto the deck, soaking the exposed crewmen as they struggled to close a hatch blown open a few minutes before by the forces of nature. Within the armoured superstructure the Captain of the vessel sat at his station, eating a ham sandwich as his bridge crew moved around him conducting their duties. <br><br>Five stories down, within the armoured citadel of the cruiser the Executive Officer paced within the CIC his eyes flicking from screen to screen. Two operators were manning the Air Search radar and the LCD screen showed the tracks of multiple aircraft, all in blue or white against the black background. The white were commercial airliners, making the slow plod between Stevid and other parts of the Western end of the region, the blue symbolised allied aircraft, mostly Shinden II Interceptors and carrier-bourne AWAC's aircraft tracing lazy, fuel efficient figure of eights as they flew BARCAP (Barrier Combat Air Patrol) for the Battle Group. There were some blue dots with small yellow markers indicating Stevidian aircraft flying from the mainland and providing additional ASW support as they dropped sonarbouys trying to locate hostile submarines.<br><br>A glance at the sonar displays showed no coverage of submerged threats. The <span style="font-style: italic">Supermarne</span> did not have a towed passive sonar array, only a bow mounted active sonar but she received the feed from the other sonar equipped vessels in the force over secure transmissions. No IHN submarines were operating in the Otium Aqua, their patrol routes had been shifted to allow them to concentrate on the seas to the North and East of the IH mainland where the large expanses of open water allowed them to hunt freely so the Battle Group was devoid of its usual two Vanguard-II Class Attack Submarines.<br><br>The XO was distracted from his pacing by the sound of an electronic printer as it begin to spit out a piece of paper. When it was done the Communications Chief tore it off and walked to the XO before handing it over. It took him ten seconds to read it.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic">Chief, take that up to the Captain for him to see. People all IHN vessels have now moved to Code Three alert posture and the ROE's now dictate that we may fire independently if the ship is under threat. That is a War Warning people and we are right in the thick of it. Intelligence does not indicate that the Kingdom is unlikely to intentionally strike us, but we are operating in close proximity to Stevidian forces and we are in a key strategic area. We await further orders from the screen commander on our position. Officer of the watch, run a full weapons diagnostic.</span>"<br><br>The CIC crew looked at each other and inwardly sighed when the XO gave that order, they had run a full systems diagnostic only fifteen hours before when the Group had been ordered to Code Two alert by the Group commander on <span style="font-style: italic">Silverthorne</span>. But like good sailors they flicked on their auxiliary monitors and began entering the command codes to perform a full diagnostic of their own detection and weapon systems.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"> Lancet Air Force Base,<br>Chinning Peninsular, The Northern Tip of the IH Mainland</span><br><br>Lancet AFB was the largest Air Force base in the north of the country boasting seven runways and well over two hundred aircraft and half as many again helicopters. Lancet was the base for three squadrons of Airbourne radar aircraft, four ASW squadrons and half a dozen interceptor and support squadrons. With the conflict between Stevid and the Kingdom heating up the bases runways were in frequent use and the humid night was no different.<br><br>Captain Dale Rogers was in the cockpit of his E-12, a military AWAC's aircraft based upon a widebodied civilian airliner. Instead of 300 seats the plane had 25 and a selection of huge supercomputers that analysed the electronic waves pumped out by the large radardome that sat on top of the aircraft body. That radar was now in standby mode as the big aircraft taxied to the end of runway one-two, the largest on the base and turned so its nose faced to the north and up the runway.<br><br>Rogers turned to his co-pilot as the aircraft settled and toggled his microphone to the control frequency.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic">Tower-Two, this is Sentinel Five. We are ready for takeoff from runway One-Two Over </span><br><br>It took a couple of seconds for the response to come through is headphones<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic"> Sentinel Five, this is Tower-Two. You are clear for takeoff on runway One-Two Over."<br><br>"Thank you Tower</span>" replied Rogers as he reached down with his right hand and pushed the throttles forward for the four turbine engines, bringing them to maximum power and forging the heavy aircraft forwards.<br><br>The airframe shook as the speed increased and Rogers made slight alterations to the yoke to keep the aircraft on the centreline as a mild crosswind pushed it left. As the speed approached 150knots he nodded at the co-pilot and as it passed 160knots he begin to pull back on the yoke, raising the front wheel off the ground. The engines continued to whine as the speed increased and the pilot said "V1" as the rear wheels left the ground and the aircraft powered its way into the nights sky, anti-collision lights blinking.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Two Hours Later....</span><br><br>Sentinel-Five was cruising at 30,000 feet nearly 800km north of Independent Hitmen and coming onto station. Half an hour before she had refueled from an orbiting tanker aircraft and been joined by her escort for the next four hours, a pair of Shinden II land-based interceptors. In the cockpit Rogers had the auto-pilot engaged and was sipping a mug of coffee as the copilot tucked into a ham sandwich, unconsciously echoing the seaman thousands of miles away.<br><br>In the cabin of the AWAC's aircraft the radar operators were at work, nine of them monitoring the various screens that displayed the information from the dome. The rest of the crew were either resting or were at their terminals ready to co-ordinate other aircraft. To their east and west other AWAC's were up as well, each radar using different frequencies so as not to disrupt each other's signal. Each had a pair of interceptors with them for protection, as dictated by the current readiness posture, ready to defend them in the unlikely instance of attack although that would have to come through the screen of IHN carriers operating in the Henderson Sea some 200km further offshore to Sentinel-Fives current position.<br><br>The crews screens showed the tracks of carrier-bourne aircraft who were aloft, none of their radar birds were broadcasting signals, preferring instead to use the data transmitted from the more powerful E-12's radar so as not to give away their positions and that of their Strike Carriers as they patrolled the oceans to the North. There were fifteen carriers down there now, with over one hundred escorts.<br><br>Though the Hitmen were not at war, they were ready for one if it came to them.</div>

<div class="content">Eastern Mordent:<br><br>The command on eastern mordent was expecting a naval invasion of the Crown controlled area. the RIN and the RIAF had received orders to attack the Stevid fleet it attacked a few days before this time it was with Hellion missiles and KH7B Viking, these would pose as a one two punch hitting the fleet still off of Morrdh.<br><br>All over the crown both RIN and RIAF where making finally preps to hundreds of bombers with different missions, the targets were any and all Stevid naval ships, ports on the northern and eastern sides of the country and ports on the western coast of Stevid/Southern Greal. Also the big push was to take out as many ships in the 5th fleet. The bombers were also carrying a new type of mine system called MOAM (Mother of all mines) it&#8217;s a cruise missile size mine with either one or two mines in it. The sensors pick a surface ship and launching a mine to float up and exploded under the ship breaking her back. <br><br>The submarine fleets had their part in the plan missile strikes on C4IRS complexes. The attack sub fleets where given orders to hunt down and attack all Stevid fleets and subs. <br><br>Southeast of the Crown.<br><br>The most massive fleet RIN has every put together their orders where to move east and link up with the forces off the coast of Arastonia, but with the fluidity of the battlefield had changed the mission somewhat but the overall objectives where the same. The fleets off of Arastonia where order to load up and move west to link up with two more longsword fleets and three HSAG and ten NAFs, along with 400 troops ships and hundreds of more support and supply ships.<br> <br>On the west side of the crown another massive fleet starts their trek south hunting surface and subsurface ships and sub of Stevid. Their orders are to strike hard and fast destroying everything within contact of the fleets. <br><br>These fleets have thousands of ships and tens of thousands of soldiers and sailors with one goal to go on the hunt in the air, on the seas and under the seas.<br><br>Back inside the crown and in a building that looked like a normal office building in the world houses the JCWC (Joint Cyber Warfare Command) this building is the tip of the spear of cyber warfare in the crown their new orders where to target Stevid&#8217;s internal command and control systems not effected by normal weapon systems. JCWC&#8217;s other orders are to harass public systems such as power, water, transportation etc.<br><br>The actions of other nations not in the conflict but making military moves were not going unnoticed; nations such as IH, Malgrave and its allies were given a simple transmission over open channels. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic">To all forces currently following and or tracking the Kingdom of Imbrinium&#8217;s naval fleets in a war that you are not involved, if you do not want to be involved in this conflict your forces need to stay at least 200nms from any RIN vessel.</span><br><br>OOC:I know this was shortand not everything was covered trying to play catch will post more ASAP.</div>

"Here is the present situation."<br><br>"On our doorstep is the Kingdom of Imbrinium, they invaded Mordent a few years back during our last skirmish with the Killian and caught us by surprise. But since then relations with them have improved, resulting in them handing half of Mordent back to the Commonwealth and there is a relation between Her Majesty and a member of the Imbrinium royal family. They're also helping us with the ongoing counter-insurgency operations in New Empire, plus they've offered us support if another war with the Killians breaks out."<br><br>"The Holy Empire of Stevid is a little bit more distant, though we have a shared history as we were originally a penal colony of theirs. But just like the Imbriniums they've offered us support against the Killians and have fought beside us in New Empire. They fought the Killians before during the War of Golden Succession a number of years ago."<br><br>"Out of the two, Imbrinium can do the most damage to us since they're on our doorstep and are in a position to blockade us. Plus they're in a better position to make an attempt on the life of Her Majesty. To this end the Holy Empire would be more favourable to go to war against if we have to, though only if they fire the first shot. I recommend sticking to our current defence plans, but draw up war plans against both Stevid and Imbrinium just in case. Though I feel our biggest threat is the Killians, so I advise against weakening our defences on the border we share with them."</div>

<div class="content">Late in the afternoon pilots and their weapons officers made their way from the briefing room to their aircraft. The medium bombers FB-23 was a fifth gen bomber that replaced the FB-111 in the RIAF and RIN. As the FB-23s moved from the staging area to the runways to take off, the crews made their last checks and prepared to take off loaded down with six HK7 anti-ship missiles. Two by two the bombers took off into the evening sky.<br><br>The FB-23s and the escort fighters were formed up in groups of ten so there will be ten waves of bombers hitting the Stevid fleet backed by heavy bombers. <br><br>At a undisclosed airbase B-90s formed in long lines on the taxiways awaiting to take off for to attack the 5th fleet of Stevid&#8217;s navy, these bombers will pound the fleet 24hrs a day till RIN fleet air arm and ships can take over. <br><br>Another goal of the RIAF was to attack Stevid&#8217;s homeland and surrounding islands, the goal was command and control networks, ports, bases, power stations etc.<br><br>In orbit over the region Stevid&#8217;s ASATs where approaching their targets. Space command tracked the missiles and tried to move those military satellites that could. The civilian satellites could do nothing besides wait to be hit. It was all over within an hour, the space above the region was thrashed with dead and damaged satellites and space debris the damage to major. The best that space command could come up with was 90% of civilian satellites where destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and at least 60% of space commands military satellites where either destroyed or damaged beyond repair. <br><br>In Imbrinium the crown had been moved out of the capital to the citadel in the mountains. With mobile radars and a network of OTH radars and airborne command and control aircraft, where taking over more and more of the war works.<br><br>The Crown was in a VTC with commanders when the sirens started going off, the royal guards rushed in and rushed the king and the royal family as fast as they could to the elevators and headed down to the safety of the mountain. The radar network picked up the launches and quickly tried to track the impact areas and intercept them the launch sites where noted and sent to patrols to attack the submarines.<br><br>200nm south of Malgrave the two submarines that had hit one another where on the surface, they were picked up by a P-8 patrol aircraft on a long range patrol looking for Stevid naval vessels. The P-8 homed in on the submarines and flew over about a 100ft above the water to film and gets a good look at them. They radioed the report back to higher and ask if there were any orders about what to do.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Absolutely not.&#8221;</span> Said The First Sea Lord Sir Gregor Austin to his sub-ordinate. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;The fleets that operate in the North Sea and Ocean beyond are not yours to expend recklessly.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;My Lord,&#8221;</span> Grand Admiral Legatos, Grand Admiral of the North Sea and Liberated America, replied sternly. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;The Stevidian Royal Navy outnumbers our enemy, we can put to sea more ships. A decisive strike against our foe at sea will send them reeling, my further plans will then succeed&#8230;&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Enough Admiral! This is folly and will not allow you to commit valuable resources to satisfy your impudence and quest for revenge. I am well aware your son was killed in the 2nd Fleet&#8217;s first engagement against the Hellion missiles, but it is no excuse for planning this outrageous course of action.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;My Lord,&#8221;</span> Legatos protested, stretching decorum to its zenith. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;I would not see the Navy&#8217;s proudest gems and assets sit idle and unable to fight to their true potential while our enemy sets the pace. A counter strike will send them into turmoil&#8230;&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Your plan needs... refinement&#8230; and there are no white elephants in this Navy. Every ship is being utilised appropriately - they are not <span style="font-weight: bold">idle</span>! I trust your military acumen. The north of the region, bar the Commonwealth of Morrdh, is seen as particularly hostile towards the Holy Empire &#8211; you are the best man for the job. Your experience counters most in the world. But this plan is ridiculous. A &#8216;sucker-punch&#8217; blow against the enemy at sea, without much in the way of potential statistical losses, followed by an invasion! This is extreme Admiral, by any stretch of the imagination. You&#8217;re going to have to come back with something better before I speak in the Prime Minister&#8217;s ear.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;My Lord!&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;I understand your lust for revenge,&#8221;</span> Sir Gregor said, more mildly this time. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;But this action is folly. What of air support? Boot on the ground cannot cope with out it; an attack against their mainland automatically draws everything they have into the pot. They send aircraft to our homeland with fool&#8217;s hope that they can return. The RAF is too far away to support and the Fleet Air Arm would be overwhelmed. It won&#8217;t work&#8230; and putting the 6th and 7th Fleets to sea in battle fleet formations to like the 2nd fleet is now will jeopardise our position here in Stevid. Liberated America is closest and likely to be invaded if the 7th Fleet removes itself entirely. The 6th Fleet is in two Splinter Fleets, south of Spectare and North of Independent Hitmen. The 6th and 7th are broken down to enforce surface, air and submarine interdiction. Battlefleet vs. battlefleet is too likely to end in defeat&#8230;&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;South Greal currently has an engagement like that.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;We have numbers, more RAF aircraft in reserve. We&#8217;re closer to home and they are further away. We can choke starve them of supplies. But in the ocean beyond the North Sea it is a level playing field. The only reason we keep them at bay is because through not submitting to decisive engagements we lose less ship and take more of theirs. If they want to float around in big groups let them. It also gives extreme AA coverage against their long-range sorties&#8230; that is something the Prime Minister will be <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> reluctant to give up. Their fleet movements have been spotted; their goal is to wipe us out. They will not be able to do while we have the numbers and the ability to avoid direct engagement. Our territory is adequately defended to repel initial invasions and in order to invade they have to play their card. The game will be given away and we will react accordingly..&#8221;</span><br><br>Legatos seemed dejected but understanding. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Aye my Lord.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;We have the upper hand in battle space.

This you might find a more entertaining read, a more overt operation than covert, but maybe something to ponder?&#8221;</span><br><br>The Admiral handed over a chunky looking file with small red text in the corner that read &#8216;Secret&#8217;. Inside was an operation proposal for the Prime Minister, one that he would find hard to refuse.<br><br><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">* * *</span></div><br><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Operation Thunder Hammer<br><br>Island South of Malgrave (Codename: <span style="font-style: italic">Hammer</span>)</span></span><br><br>The RAF were pounded the island into oblivion. Care was taken to try and avoid major population centres, but collateral was something that was getting harder to avoid. Key targets had been spotted by forward aircraft elements, aircraft that were lost to enemy ground fire and combat sorties. But the sacrifice was not in vain. The escorting fighters were allowed to engage and harass at will, to not be tied to a bomber gave great flexibility to defend said bombers. The targets were ID&#8217;d as runways (makeshift and concrete) and Army FOBs and Ops. From the digital photographs and intel that was beginning to manifest in the aftermath of the ASAT strikes, educated guesses could be made about locations of command and control centres.<br><br>Scorpion strike aircraft dived into the fray first launching AGM-65s in multiples to fragment what AA defences had been erected by the occupying forces. With their short time on the island, the RAF did not envisage much in the way of static AA defence that could not be easily overwhelmed. Strafing runs on camps were conducted too while enemy aircraft were engaged by Nightwalker and Hawker aircraft. But the main show was yet to come&#8230;<br><br>SAS troops on the ground numbered less than 40. A smaller presence meant less chance of detection and the odd fire team had managed to send back some details on enemy positions. But only one team was close enough to a large enemy camp that could potentially be base of operations. They couldn&#8217;t say, enemy patrols were expert and well equipped in terms of clearing the outer perimeter of the fence and beyond. The SAS observation team were several kilometres away on a rocky ridge, but had a good enough view to rely coordinates and observe aircraft and also armour and light vehicles entering and leaving. Their view would be spectacular.<br><br>Three waves of ten B6-A Armburst (Crossbow) strategic bombers entered the airspace over Hammer. The RAF fighters arrived en mass with over 40 fighters and quickly engaged enemy aircraft rising to meet them. The B6s flew fast and relatively low to counter AA radar and tried to use the terrain mask, of what little there was, to hide their approach as best as possible.<br><br>2,000lb <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kLJQgejcUQ" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">JDAM</a> free-fall precision bombs were released in the hundreds with over 100 being dropped on this base alone. But in the third wave came the final word of Stevidian air power. Though bomber losses meant the third sortie had suffered, enough made it through to this base to deliver the killing blow. Just one bomb was dropped and the explosion was cataclysmic. In a throw back to the bygone days of World War 2 and the escalation of weapons development in the Cold War, this bomb was truly colossal. Similar to the Earthquake bomb &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_bomb" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Grand Slam</a>&#8217;, this one guided bomb caused an explosion and ground tremor that made the SAS observers flee fearing it was a nuclear weapon. This conventional bomb however caused so much smoke it was impossible to tell what exactly it had pulverised. Enemy reaction in the air was swift as the last bombers of the third wave were mercilessly gunned down while the other fled to Stevidian South Greal. The Scorpions and B6 aircraft elsewhere continued pounding the island until their munitions were spent. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Sea West of Malgrave (Codename: <span style="font-style: italic">Thunder</span>)</span></span><br><br>It was not the sound of real thunder, but that of Stevidian missiles and gunfire. <br><br>The Royal Navy now closed in for the kill with the southern element of the fleet in a diversionary attack North in an attempt to draw Imbrinium naval activity south to engage them. A move that would be seen as bold and daring (or on the other hand reckless and mentally crazy), this Splinter fleet of the 5th Fleet was charging within missile and main gun range of the enemy fleet that included the lone Longsword super dreadnought. This splinter fleet had two gems of the navy, HMS Warcry, an Inquisition class dreadnought and HMS Resolute, a Sanguineous super dreadnought. Their 23&#8221; and 25&#8221; ETC guns respectively, were in indirect range as too were their heavy missile armaments; the Sanguineous alone could churn out nearly 10,000 missiles in one barrage (if so required). Both flanked by two Emperor Class missile battleships, over 8 light missile cruisers and a bulwark of Lemartes Class destroyers, the fleet was more than protected from whatever challenge laid ahead.<br><br>Sitting back in reserve were the fleet carriers of the Splinter Fleet. Their aircraft cover was crucial and formed part of the main effort driving forward from the west. Over 2,000 aircraft would be involved in fighting throughout the day with 40% coming from the southern splinter fleet alone. The RAF would support the main attack further north together with the Fleet Air Arm. The planes from the southern fleet started to take losses. Their goal was to be seen as &#8216;flies&#8217; bothersome and infuriating to deal with. They exacted their losses on the enemy and made effort to attack the Longsword SDN, seeing as it wasn&#8217;t hard to miss. But the main effort was the carriers and great impotence was put on their destruction. <br><br>In a deliberate move, the fleet to the North made little effort to assist the initial attack and only made probing strikes forwards with aircraft to attempt to destroy the picket line. <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Deorum Irae</span>, another Sanguineous SDN, made herself big and attractive. She remained in long AA missile range of the two carrier task forces of the Splinter Fleet, but made special effort to be noticed. Deliberate, and staggered, long range cruise missile attacks against enemy carriers identified by the attacking aircraft of the other fleet, and also the Longsword. Minor missile strikes against other surface shipping continued and she spat radio chatter on both encrypted and unencrypted channels &#8211; some the enemy might even decipher. She was calling out to be challenged, to be attacked. She wanted to be the target, and at the best of times a SDN was hard to ignore. In case she, or the fleet for that matter, was undermined, the ASW patrols were alarmingly intense. Some contacts were found to be straying close and were ushered away but with no confirmed kills. Stevidian submarines lurked below as well, but were not stupid enough to attack the enemy fleet &#8211; RIN were just as professional and would not tolerate Stevidian submarines snaking their way into the midst of their fleet. The Stevidian Submarine Service now had a reputation with Imbrinium after the surprise missile attack early in the war &#8211; foolhardiness was not a vice it wished to be associated with.<br><br>The RAF was in heavy support of the main drive, which had yet to get into gear. They were close to home and would flo0d the enemy radar from the northwest, west, southwest and south. Bomber Command was using a lot of assets in this attack with over 70 bombers to engage in Thunder Hammer with another 40 in reserve in Stevidian South Greal, the bombers were all equipped with long range stand off weapons for engaging naval targets. No bombs, the aircraft were too valuable to waste. But the Scorpion strike aircraft and Nightwalker fighters would be in the thick of it and would team up with their counter parts in the Fleet Air Arm as the main thrust from the west began in the air. With thunder would come lightening and while the southerly splinter fleet was engaging first headlong and getting amongst the enemy, the penetration from all angles from the westerly direction was to hopefully overwhelm the enemy air defence.<br><br>Word of a huge aerial &#8216;fur-ball&#8217; was not an exaggeration as the air-superiority fighter jets danced high above the fleet and along its perimeter defences, while the strike aircraft of Stevid attempted to break and engage surface targets. Comms chatter would have been chaotic but the Stevidian Defiler Command and Control cruiser with its multiple super computers, as well as those on the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Deorum Irae</span>, filtered all information and put it through visual displays and entered it into the battle space. Information dissemination was paramount and it was working. On the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Deorum Irae</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">HMS&#8217;s Resolute and Warcry</span>, and every other echelon ship leader could see what was unfolding and major threats that were presenting themselves.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span><br><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Northern Stevid</span></span><br><br>It was kind of fun and exciting at first. The age old World War 2 relic castle casting air raid sirens firing to life once again with their ominous, and terrifying, rising and falling drones. The province of northern province Eldrich was a forbidding place in winter, but this summer was remarkably pleasant. Still chilly at 10 degrees C and even colder up in the huge mountain ranges of the Richian Highlands that were usually covered in snow all year round. The chill meant that when the sirens began to wail everyone was more than happy to dart excitedly into tube stations, shopping centres, underground car parks, civil defence bunkers, and of course home made shelters as requested by the government.<br><br>It was a chance to meet people, get to know one another more personally in a digital age where interaction in person simply isn&#8217;t &#8216;cool&#8217; anymore. Papers ran stories of romances, air raid communities gathering together outside of the raid to do bits for the war and for charities. The whole idea of an air raid was novel, something out of a war film.<br><br>But the excitement waned in time. The raids were now more inconvenient than anything. The communities still blossomed and people still tried to enjoy themselves, but everyone would rather they could just get on with their lives.<br><br>The raids themselves focused mainly on port facilities in the north. They were the easiest targets, though heavily defended. Airfields too were targeted, but again&#8230; defended. Damage was caused to both military and civilian infrastructure. One bombing run put an airbase out of commission for a projected time of over three months. But overall attacks on military installations would be met mostly with negative or inconclusive results. But the enemy pushed on, some spearheading drives deeper into the country and attempting to take out power stations and their substations- these results were more positive. The Northern National Grid suffered random brown outs over the cause of a week after one station was damaged beyond repair, that couple with cyber attacks, it was hard to keep everything on. Military/Government installations, hospitals and other emergency service centres took priority and their power was not troubled. But citizens watch soaps on TV were left infuriated.<br><br>It was made worse for the enemy in terms of detection, not only by the Royal Navy at see tipping off the mainland upon aircraft detection, but the two radar installations on Eleanor Mountain ridge in the Richian Highlands. On two ridges close to one another only 15 miles apart were two jointly run radar sites sitting atop the snow-capped ridge. Forming of the Greater Dienstad ballistic missile defence radar network, these twinned installations were known collectively as RAF Snowden Peak; better known by is public and military nickname &#8211; The Northern Eye.<br>Utilising advanced detection methods, mathematic algorithms, CELLDAR, huge phased arrays, the line of white &#8216;golf balls&#8217; kept an unrelenting eye on the skies to the north and overlapped coverage to the west and east by several degrees. The Northern Eye had its own uplink to the combined service&#8217;s battle space and with this could pin point targets with a good range of accuracy. Though not the only radar installation in the Stevid, it was prominent and provided Stevidian Air Defence a way of cross-referencing data already collected on targets penetrating Stevidian airspace.<br><br><br><div style="margin:5px; margin-top:5px"><div class="quotetitle"><input class="button2 btnlite" type="button" value="Show Spoiler" style="text-align:center;width:100px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';      this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide Spoiler'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show Spoiler'; } return false;"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">OOC: Post is long enough without me gibbering on about the attack on my fleet south of Morrdh.

Organised Chaos took over as Technicians began checking equipment for faults and contacting regional centres to double and even triple check data they were receiving, with some even making quick calls to the Ministry of Defence to check if they'd not been informed of any exercises planned for today. <br><br>"Someone give me a status report. I want to know who is firing, where they are firing from and if any of our forces have been engaged in fighting" Rear Admiral Wallis ordered as he stepped out of his small office, the fact that the middle-aged Malgravean had actually commanded a fleet in combat operations carried considerable weight amongst the newer sailors who quickly scrambled to provide him with a situational report. <br><br>"Sir. We have confirmed multiple launches of anti-ship missiles and Air-Force Intelligence are reporting that dozens of aircraft are currently engaged in bombing runs against military targets on the island of Arastonia." A young Technician said, rather nervously looking at the Read Admiral who simply nodded and signally for the person next to him to start speaking. <br><br>"We can confirm that no Malgravean vessel has been targeted or has fired any of its weapons during the incident The Valiant however is relaying a report from the fleet that the naval forces of Imbrinium have started laying mines off the coa.." another Technician attempted to add, her words interrupted by the Rear Admiral who immediately sprinted to the nearest telephone, a rushed conversation with Admiral Campioni following before he hung-up and began coordinating an appropriate report for the Prime Minister to read. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Briefing Room - Government Sector - Epping - Malgrave</span></span><br><br>Robert Leipzig took another large gulp from his coffee as he read the rather rushed report in front of him, freshly delivered from the hands of Naval and Air Intelligence just moments ago. The Malgravean Defence Minister had been briefed on the situation around twenty minutes ago and had been informed that he needed to create a small presentation fo deliver to the Prime Minister, something that had been easily achieved by himself and his personal team that were quite used in creating small packets of information for the Minister to deliver to the PM<br><br>"Prime Minister, it seems that two regional powers have decided to engage in battle right outside our front door. We've remained neutral in this conflict so far however I must inform you that the Kingdom of Imbrinium have started laying anti-ship mines off the coast. I don't think I need to inform you of the implications that has on the Malgravean economy, if even one state-owned or foreign merchant vessel sinks we could see that companies including the state-owned Merchant Marine are no longer willing to supply our country." Robert said as he finished his presentation, the latest satellite imagery stood behind him including recent intelligence reports on each major piece of equipment that both sides fielded. <br><br>"You are correct to be rather concerned of these developments Robert, considering how reliant we are on foreign resources to maintain our rate of industrial growth and current construction projects these mines shall have a fairly large impact on the wider economy if we do not dispatch of them immediately. I shall also be calling an emergency session of parliament in order to discuss this crisis and authorise the strong use of military force" the Prime Minister replied, hush tones heard in the background as she mentioned the possibility of further military action. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Parliament - Government Sector - Epping</span></span><br><br>Parliament was much quieter than usual, the typically heard jokes and rather childish behaviour of some MP's had completely disappeared as the weight of the decision before them was clear on everyones minds. The Prime Minister was currently rounding up a quick summary of events and intelligence collected from the Ministry of Defence, concentration clear on her face as she remembered terms and numbers she had learnt over her lifetime.<br><br>"In short we are faced with a momentous decision today. Foreigners have aggressively situated themselves outside our nation waters and refused to move, even engaging in military operations against an undefended and peaceful island. The country responsible for this illegal and unsanctioned aggression have now begun to start mining waters close to the territorial waters of our nation, something that threatens the continued growth and stability of the entire Malgravean economy. We cannot allow our economic future to be dictated by foreigners and I hope that everyone in this room feels the same. I call for parliament to authorise military action against these scoundrels!" Prime Minister Rachel Berry shouted, the brief reverberating cheers behind her signifying that she had the support of her party and the majority she needed already.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Portsmouth Coastal Fortifications - Military Sector </span></span><br><br>In the first years after relocation, the Malgravean coast had been peppered with coastal fortifications, all with varying forms of artillery designed to keep potential hostile forces at bay despite isolationist policies. Despite these artillery outposts becoming long outdated by the arrival of surface-to-surface missiles they had remained in joint service with the Royal Navy and Army, who had quickly adapted them to suit the more adaptive mobile and stationary anti-ship missiles and the Army that had positioned its reserve heavy artillery forces in the area so they could be quickly positioned to act against surface vessels in extraordinary situations. <br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Nayton confidently looked upon the map in front of him, the Malgravean was tasked with organising the ground part of the operation. It had been decided by the Ministry of Defence that because the hostile fleet was so close to the Malgravean mainland that it would be logical for local ground assets to start engaging naval vessels alongside that of the Navy and Air-Force. <br><br>"It seemed that the ancestors are smiling at as lad, we have four entire battalions of heavy artillery at our disposal and that is without thinking of whatever mobile junk the Navy brought with them" The Lieutenant Colonel said to a young private, the Malgravean had noticed the chap looking quite nervous and did not want any jitters disturbing his operation.<br><br>Elsewhere across the region the Navy was organising its own defensive operations on the surface, unlike the Army who had situated its forces within a five kilometre radius of the old fortifications the Navy had dispersed its forces over a ten kilometre range near the coast. In total two battalions worth of mobile launchers had been carefully moved into position alongside logistical support and ammunition vehicles. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">HMS Valiant - Malgrave</span></span><br><br>Work in the situational room continued as normal, even as Rear Admiral Polis stepped into the centre of the room, only a few slowing down momentarily when they saw the look of determination on his face. <br><br>"We have just been ordered by the Ministry of Defence to immediately engage the vessels belonging to the Kingdom of Imbrinium. I want to see every single aircraft launched from these aircraft carriers as soon as possible and I want confirmation that the fleet is prepared to relay information between allied vessels and coordinate defence against retaliation. We shall encounter losses during this operation but I want to ensure that those are kept as low as possible, something that should be ensured if you each give me your best" the Malgravean ordered, the situational room and the entire ship turning into a hive of activity as crew readied aircraft for take-off and began coordinating with fellow vessels of the fleet.<br><br>Orders were quickly dispatched from the Carrier to other ships in the fleet through encrypted channels, with preparations soon underway for the upcoming battle. Sailors could be seen making last minute checks to offensive and defensive weapons systems before the Epping Class Destroyer and Broadsword Fleet Defence Ships started unloading on the enemy fleet. Ships lurched and sailors covered their ears as missile after missile streaked from the Destroyers of the Royal Malgravean Navy. It was tough work however the crew of the Royal Naval vessels in the region had finally managed to work together with Military Intelligence long enough to get a list of suitable military targets to strike against, their primary target was the enemies Longsword vessel which had been marked for immediate destruction by the Ministry of Defence.<br><br>In total around 400 <a href="http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=91878#p4509358" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">missiles</a> were launched from the ships of the Royal Navy towards the Imbrinium fleet, with the close range of the vessels meaning that artillery from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otobreda_127/64" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Epping Class Destroyer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otobreda_76_mm" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Broadsword Fleet Defence</a> were also being brought to bear against the Longsword.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Skies over Malgrave</span></span><br><br>In total around 80 aircraft had initially been deployed by the Royal Air-Force from multiple airfields in the south of the country, the two multi-role and attack aircraft squadrons had been outfitted with mostly anti-ship missiles, although for regulations sake they had been outfitted with a singular air-to-air missile. The TU-22's in the group were the mainstay naval strike aircraft of the Malgravean Air-Force, each carrying six Kh-15 anti-ship missiles on a rotary launcher with a further four on underwing pylons. The Typhoons, the main fighter aircraft of the country carried four Joint Strike anti-ship missiles. In addition, the force had recently been joined by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-160" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Heavy Bomber Squadron</a> from Tillingham Airbase.

Fires burned out of control and troops manned their stations still while others helped the wounded and dying. One the hanger&#8217;s setup for a hospital was completely destroyed now and burning. The command cell was in disarray some had been restored, the second in command had been killed in the attack while saving a wounded trooper. The civilian towns where equally wrecked and burning the civilian wounded where being airlifted to the hospital ships, the first reports of causalities reports looked grim at best.<br><span style="font-style: italic">600+ IAF (Imbrinium Armed Forces) dead<br>400+IAF wounded <br>100+Missing<br>200+ Civilians dead<br>400+Wounded <br>75+Missing</span><br>The equipment issues stated on the first reports, primary fuel depot hit and burning, ammo dump hit and unable to be controlled due to explosions, RIN freighter on fire and taking on water docked at the port, the airfield closed due to craters to runways, 16 airlift aircraft destroyed, 37 fighters destroyed, 20 helicopters destroyed, 10 civilian aircraft destroyed, airfield terminal hit and on fire uncontrolled, &#188; of all civilian buildings damaged or destroyed. <br>The commander of Mako looked at this report and sat back into his chair in shock of the reports. The mission was at risk of failing and the IAF may have to abandon the island. Some units where ordered to moved back to a fall back point about 200kms southeast of Mako. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">100kms west of Mako,</span><br><br>The fleet was making it&#8217;s way to link up with task iron craw to destroy the Stevid 5th fleet and invade southern Greal when the report make its way to the flag ship. Holy shit, Sir Mako got hammered, it sounds bad. &#8220;Yes it does son, yes it does&#8221;<br>Deep in the CIC the OTH radar operators picked up ships and aircraft coming in from the west, the AWACs aircraft confirmed the radar contacts. The fleet commander ordered the fleet from condition 2 to condition 1 throughout the fleets. The anti-air batteries went to active search, the fleets ABM systems went to active search. The carriers where launching their aircraft to intercept the incoming enemy forces. The vessels of the fleet locked onto the targets it could and launch the full banks of hellion IIs, the plan was to strike first and strike hard. The command staff where looking over the maps and the positions of the fleet in relation to the Stevid fleet. The crown had taken a heavy hit on satellite coverage but with a deal from allies that was no long a problem. The fleet could now get up to date live intelligence along with the rest of the military. <br><br>A large battle was forming and the outcome would be down to the men and equipment of both nations. The escort ships that formed the out ring of defence started to pick up possible missiles from the north but there weren&#8217;t any reports of anything to the north except for the Malgrave force on alert. <br><br>Report where sent up and orders sent back down to confirm and report. <br><br>&#8220;Sir the radar picture is in and out they could be low to the ground or using stealth missiles sir.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Find them and find out who&#8217;s they are I want a fix&#8221;<br>&#8220;I got them back sir definitely got tracks holy shit vampire!

The weapons to be used where Hellion II loaded with HE/HE cluster, mine/ chemical/ chemical cluster. This would be the first time the Crown had signed off on using chemical weapons on a city.

<div class="content">The hammering of one of the 2nd Fleet&#8217;s splinter fleets continued with mixed to bad results for the Royal Navy. The actually splinter fleet itself had been mauled and even air support from the supporting splinter fleet was beginning to wain.<br>Already three carriers were either damaged or destroyed including a Sanctus Mare Class super carrier. The Inquisition Class DN the Oblivion had been evacuated upon being struck by several missiles and she was now listing and taking cannon fire from Stevidian ships to hasten her sinking to prevent any form of salvage by the enemy. The one Sanguineous Class SDN, The HMS Cataclysm, had also taken multiple hits and had lost all use of her main guns and her missiles placed amidships. Though her role now as a pincushion was coming into its own. Her missile reserves were far from empty and picky choosing of target engagement, thanks solely to the information tapped into from the battle space overview, meant she was engaging most target aiming for the pickets of the fleet and direct threats to the carrier while shorter range missiles, CIWS and lasers engaged missile targeting her. Superstructure damage was intense and the battle scars were clear to see and yet the pounding continued, she was just too hard to ignore. <br><br>The splinter fleet had been reduced to 30% strength and was retreating southeast to meet up with the other splinter fleet, combine and head outside of the missile range and into the range of supporting RAF flights from north-eastern Stevid and Liberated America. It would be then the price for smashing the 2nd Fleet any further would be too costly for Imbrinium. As a whole the 5th Fleet&#8217;s strength would be depleted to 40% taking into account the lost of escorts and capital ship value. The fleet was to be replaced by the 4th Fleet over the next week and the 2nd was to be disbanded and reformed into a new splinter fleet sized force known as the &#8216;Northern Monitors&#8217; to deter attacks against Stevidian holdings in Liberated America, Rubet and of course Northern Stevid.<br><br>It was easy to see that a direct assault against Imbrinium would be doomed to failure, and perhaps folly for the enemy to try anything similar. But with the upper hand in terms of comms and battle space management, it would be foolish to let up the war effort despite being batted away from the seas south of Morrdh.<br>While avoid decisive battle between major battle fleets, elements of the 6th and 7th (currently defending northern approaches to Stevid and north of Zarbia and Liberated America respectively) would continue to search and destroy, in small task forces, enemy ships out at sea. Support if needed would be called and would come in the form of the RAF. The war would now be fought at arms length from the mainland to prevent enemy planes becoming too comfortable while avoiding the Royal Navy with the top cover it deserved.<br><br>Stevidian submarines would harass the larger fleets of Imbrinium. These submarines had been lurking north of Stevid and in the ocean between the homeland and South Greal since the conflict started having not been committed to attacking Imbrinium en mass or being tied up around Stevid thanks to the help from IH. Support by cruise missiles from bombers and strike fighters from Stevid and carriers. A stable and affordable naval war of attrition would be fought against the Kingdom. With naval task forces floating all over the ocean, the Empire was ready to commit hundreds of vessels from several directions against enemy task forces or even battle fleets whenever kinks in the defence opened up. Stevid fully intended to use the battle space control before the conflict&#8217;s end.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">OP THUNDER HAMMER</span></span><br><br>The battle between the two fleets continued with the Stevidian 5th Fleet completing its pincer movement against the enemy fleet. With the island south of Malgrave now nearly in ruins, less effort was placed on the island and focus shifted to the naval battle. The island&#8217;s key defensive points, including airbases/airfields, and also naval ports would be hammered further by medium range strike aircraft and shore based cruise missile batteries of the Royal Artillery &#8211; removing anything of strategic importance and freeing up additional aircraft. With the additional aircraft combined with the relatively intact Fleet Air Arm, nearly 700 combat aircraft to engage the enemy fleet. In practice it was closer to 500 as the west cost of South Greal had its defences bolstered by the additional aircraft.<br><br>As opposed to the fleet action in the north-west of the region, this was entirely different. Stevid had the luxury of continued air support, it also had incredibly short supply lines and distances between ships and port. Ships were rotated out of the combat zones that were out of missiles or shells only to return hours later with refreshed munitions. In a manner of speaking, the Holy Empire was now no longer hammering the enemy fleet &#8211; it was throwing nearly everything that wasn&#8217;t in reserve following the attacks on the island.<br><br>The tactics of dropping mines amongst the fleet achieved results, if not intercepted, and crippled two light carriers and even left the HMS Divine Penance Inquisition class DN dead in the water and listing heavily whilst still continuing to fight while non-essential crew abandoned the floundering ship. These mines also destroyed several cruisers and escorts. The fleet losses were creeping up and the larger ships capable of withstanding prolonged punishment were beginning were starting to falter; however the losses, while shocking considering the lives involved, were more sustainable by the Royal Navy in this part of the world.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">His Majesty&#8217;s Imperial Office of Overseas Defence &#8211; Stevidian South Greal</span></span><br><br>With a video link tied in to Lowland Road, the Prime Minister&#8217;s official residence in Stevid, this building was the head of operations in relation to the on-going conflict. Politicians, Generals, Admirals etc. gathered daily for regular updates from the Capital as well as voicing opinions, probable strategies and potential political courses of action. The overall head of operations against the Kingdom of Imbrinium in the east, including Op Thunder Hammer, was briefing the Defence Cabinet back in Stevid, with the Prime Minister at the head of the table.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;In conclusion Prime Minister, we believe that a continued drive with further use of the aircraft freed up from the island bombardment, the naval battle will continue in our favour. We anticipate a fighting retreat given the official war declaration from Malgrave. Despite mediation from the Freethinkers, I cannot foresee the Kingdom remaining here for much longer &#8211; it is simply too far away to main this level of aggression without eventually compromising homeland security.&#8221;</span> Briefed General Adams of the Stevidian VII Army in South Greal.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Agreed.&#8221;</span> Replied Prime Minster Conroy. <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Is there an update on enemy movements to corroborate this?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Indications from satellite feeds and data networks monitoring the real time situation of the battle suggest a southerly movement.&#8221; Admiral Doherty, Chief of Theatre Naval Staff, piped up. &#8220;Indications why are unclear as it does not conform with a direct retreat to Imbrinium. However we have detected another large fleet approaching presumably to link up with the enemy fleet we&#8217;re engaged with now.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Is our position tenable sir?&#8221;</span> The Minister of Defence quizzed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Reasonably so, yes Minister. With third party pressure from Malgrave they have more to worry about. Our fleet is suitably placed to continue the fight and our losses are as such that while crippled we can still fight a protracted interdiction battle. Another decisive battle between two fleets will end with monumental losses on both sides. Considering the war declaration from Malgrave is a spanner in the works the Kingdom will be wanting to remove the 5th Fleet from the equation in decisive battle&#8230; which we intend to avoid.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Are you suggesting we withdraw from the battle sir?&#8221;</span> The Prime Minister asked in a surprised tone.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;No sir, on the contrary. I suggest we throw everything we have at the Imbrinium fleet before they link up the one they have sent as reinforcements. With a heavy focus on the escorts, we wipe out as many as possible to weaken their defences. Carriers, battleships, dreadnoughts, all are useless without protection. Too many big boats and not enough escorts is a woe. As soon as the other enemy fleet is within range then we will continue with the strategy we have implemented North of Stevid and harry the enemy with smaller task forces and force the Imb navy to engage us indirectly where we operate best.&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Akin to being annoying flies sir?&#8221;</span> A Minister joked, a joke the Admiral found distasteful.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;I find flies tend to lose battles, but the metaphor works all the same.

They are still a third party in this conflict and have openly declared war on the Kingdom. A mistake by either side could draw the Empire into a war with Malgrave. I&#8217;m a firm believer of &#8216;An enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8217;. Malgrave maybe willing to discuss agreements so long as we are open to possible military concessions. If anything it could prove a point to Imbrinium that diplomacy, as opposed to their outward aggression, is a better policy they should have follow?&#8221;</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;That is already underway. We also have a propaganda display prepared, as way of informing the enemy just where this conflict could go. There is a lot of pressure on me to openly declare war, but considering Stevid has just come off the war footing I&#8217;d rather not wreck the economy &#8211; this conflict has to potential to drag on a while longer and will not be finished by Christmas. Also, Admiral Doherty&#8230;?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Prime Minister?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;The Admiralty has approved your request asking for additional vessels to be sent to Stevidian South Greal. Three quarters of the 4th Fleet stationed off the west coast of South Greal are to remain defending that coast and are to continue probing out to sea seeking out enemy activity. A splinter fleet of 300 vessels of the 1st Fleet will be sent to recoup numbers of the 5th. They are already on their way. The other half will continue to defend the Southern Reaches with aid of Independent Hitmen&#8230; thank you for you time ladies and gentlemen&#8230;&#8221;</span></div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Morrdun, Morrdh</span><br><br>Prime Minister Edmund Vermillion read the latest reports on the Stevidian-Imbrinium conflict and sighed, <span style="font-style: italic">Such a terrible waste of life.</span><br><br>It pained him to see two of the Commonwealth's greatest allies at each other's throats, trading missile and shot as the two fought the other to seemingly mutual destruction. More troubling was the recent of involvement of the Malgraveans and Freethinkers, something that was sparking fears of a much more larger conflict than what had previously been imagine. The situation had the possibly of sparking the largest conflict Greater Dienstad had seen since the War of Golden Succession, unless action was taken to avoid that outcome.<br><br>On the desk in front of him were the attack plans for Stevid and Imbrinium that the defence staff had drawn up, all they required was his signature and they would be put into action. Whilst there was the possibly of either of them bringing the war to a swift conclusion, there was the risk that the Commonwealth could alienate one of its allies. It was a decision that Vermillion hoped he wouldn't have to make, secretly he dared to hope that either of the two combatants would strike first and take the matter out of his hands. Though there was other factors at play, chiefly rising tensions with the Killians which meant that the critical border defences couldn't be weakened least the Killians invade.<br><br>With another sigh he placed the two attack plans into a drawer of his desk, then locked the drawer so that they were out of sight if not out of mind.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">OOC:</span> Morrdh and I have discussed this before.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Inside Morridane waters</span><br><br>It had not been an easy trek for the four Lamonian nuclear submarines that had brought four "gifts" for the Morridane Navy to enter and lurk in Morridane waters without being detected. The entire trip had been a very precisely timed and tense operation, with each submarine operating at slow speeds for maximum stealth. However, this was the day that their gifts would be "presented." One by one, small CRACK! sounds came from explosive bolts that seperated the tow cables that each of the nuclear submarines carried in order to drag the presents with them. Anyone watching Morridane surface radar would be surprised when four unidentified contacts would now appear on their scopes as the presents broke the surface.<br><br>Each of these presents was a <a href="http://z4.invisionfree.com/NSDraftroom/index.php?showtopic=10805" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Divinus class SSK,</a> and they each carried a full load of Mk-20 Mothra torpedos, and Umkhonto SAMs. However, not one soul was aboard any of these submarines, and even the full instruction and operation manuals aboard made no mention to a specific nation.<br><br>The four Lamonian nuclear attack submarines fanned out in different directions, thereby making the job of finding all four of them a much more difficult proposition for any ASW forces that may be in the area. The four surfaced diesel submarines would seem FAR more important anyway, it was hoped. The submarines could have been delivered far more publically, but with the Stevid/Imbrinium war raging, no one was certain how either party in that war would react to weapons deliveries to the Commonwealth. This despite the fact that the Commonwealth of Morrdh was a neutral party in that war. These Divinus class submarines were modern designs, and respresented an improvement over the Oberon class submarines already in use by the Commonwealth.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tillingham Airbase - Tillingham - Northern Malgrave</span></span><br><br>A strange screeching noise pierced the evening sky, the distant thud of newspapers and tea impacting the cold floor and joining the now familiar wail of the rusting klaxon. Aircrew and Pilots rushed into action to perform a routinely practised drill, the scrambling of fighters and interceptors to repel and incoming force of hostile aircraft, a symphony of pure chaos now filling the air as the screaming klaxon seemed to blend perfectly with the raw sound of aircraft moving into position and aircrew preparing other aircraft to move into position. It was a familiar sight across many Malgravean airfields especially those alongside the boarder, what made this different from any other mission is that the incoming threat was real.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence had long stationed a force of a singular interceptor, light fighter and attack aircraft squadron to grant the country protection against potential incursions from the North and provide needed fire-power to destroy the insurgency that plagued the mountainside for decades. Since the start of tensions between the Kingdom of Imbrinium and Malgrave these forces had been bolstered with an additional three squadrons of fighters and interceptors from the reserve force that had been brought up from airbases near the capital to exterior facilities like Tillingham that were regarded as the first line of defence against foreign aggression. <br><br>At the moment two squadrons of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-105_Arrow" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Avro Arrow</a> interceptors and two squadrons <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Avion" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Avro Sparrow</a> light fighters were being sent into the skies, each squadron tasked with the complete annihilation of the bomber force that had been detected around three hundred kilometres away and they were fully outfitted with anti-aircraft missiles to fulfil this duty. In addition to these aircraft the facilities anti-aircraft defence installations were kicking into gear, with around two dozen S-300 sites stationed around the airbase and wider region actively engaging the targets with a full barrage of missiles. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ministry of Defence HQ - Government Sector - Epping - Malgrave</span></span><br><br>Robert Leipzig fell to the floor as his office shook around him, the Defence Minister narrowly missing a fairly nasty impact with the side of his desk, the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps invading his eardrums before he was unceremoniously and rather crudely checked for injuries before being assisted upright.<br><br>"What the hell was that?" Robert shouted, although a part of him already knew that it must of been an explosion of some kind. The Defence Minister had been part of the government during earlier attempts by insurgents to infiltrate and destroy buildings inside the government sector so he recognised the tell-tale sounds and responses to an explosion.<br><br>"We've been hit by a couple of cruise missiles, sir. Details are sketchy at the moment in the immediate aftermath but we are also getting reports that similar military and non-military buildings have been struck around the capital." Thomas replied with a frown on his face, the young civil servant had just started working for the Ministry of Defence having worked at the Ministry of Housing and Urban development and inwardly hoped that none of his friends had been killed.<br><br>"I want information on the health of the Queen, Prime Minister and every single minister and I want every bloody coastal fortification within range of those bastards to take action and I want this done five minutes ago!" Robert ordered, the enraged Defence Minister already beginning to work on rearranging his desk<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Portsmouth Coastal Fortification Beta- Military Sector </span></span><br><br>Celebrations planned after the successful strike against the forces of Imbrinium were quickly cancelled once the news of the attacks against government buildings in the capital flooded through, the party attitude replaced with one of anger and anguish as soldiers individually and collectively hoped that they had not lost family, friends or lovers today. <br><br>Paranoia and the start of a wide ranging and aggressive insurgency against the Malgravean state had long required that major military installations across the country had suitable protection and redundancies in place for dealing with military strikes and acts of terrorism. Military operations were continuing as usual and Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Nayton had been quickly tasked with distributing an adequate response to the hostile fleet stationed off the coast. <br><br>"Don't worry lads. We got hit fairly hard in certain civilian government centres but the majority of important military business is handled underground. Epping also has one of the most effective emergency task forces in the nation, not as good as Pakosc but the Territorial Defence Force should be able to lend a hand with rescue operations." The Lieutenant Colonel exclaimed in an attempt to raise morale in his tent. <br><br>In truth the Lieutenant Colonel was feeling a little out of his depth, the Malgravean had recently been tasked with coordinating a response alongside the four coastal defence battalions of the Royal Navy and the planned arrival of a Brigadier from Epping seemed to be on the back burner since the news of strikes against the capital. Stepping outside of his tent the Lieutenant saw a sight that brightened his day, the full cooperation of the Army and Navy. It had taken several minutes for the BM-30's to be in a position to fire once more and they had some small problems with positioning the additional mobile launchers into position, but witnessing the launch of 1536 Smerch rounds and 512 BrahMos missiles was an amazing sight to behold and a clear sign that logistical centres across the region and wider country and goods and helicopters of the Air Force had kicked it up a gear since the strike against the capital and been permitted to activate war supplies and rapid supply methods.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Parliament Building - Government Sector - Epping</span></span><br><br>Quinn Fabray-Berry groaned in pain as she gently touched her forehead, the Malgravean sighing in resignation when she saw it was covered in blood before she slowly rose for her position on the floor, quickly using the floor to stabilise her shaky legs and stop her from immediately falling back onto the dusty rubble strewn floor. Quinn knew that she at least had a concussion from the blast and probably needed to be checked by a medical professional fairly soon but at the moment she did not care, the Malgravean more focused in finding her wife.<br><br>The Inner Circles of Parliament were a maze of corridors that contained a multitude of offices belonging to a seemingly endless list of required and frankly pointless departments that helped keep the parliament running as efficiently or inefficiently as possible and Quinn was currently running through them like her life depended on it, and it some ways it did, ever since she had met her future partner all those years ago in a rural political convention it seemed like their lives had been intertwined and fate and possibly a little work from the ancestors had ensured that they would live the rest of their lives together and Quinn was not going to have that end prematurely. <br><br>Parliament has long had a connection to musical productions and Quinn had left Rachel to organise the future charity performance in peace while she went ahead with finishing some paper work. Entering the room Quinn immediately rushed to her wife's aide whose foot was currently being tended to by one of the buildings medical staff.<br><br>"We need to get you to a hospital immediately. I'll call ahead and get a helicopter to take you to the nearest available hosp.." Quinn said at an incredibly pace, her words interrupted with a single finger placed on her lips.<br><br>"I'm fine! I simply lost my footing when the explosions happened and sprained my ankle. I've been given some painkillers and I am perfe...." Rachel replied, stopping halfway when she noticed the bloody cut on her partners forehead. "I'll call for that helicopter right away.

Hundreds of airmen loaded onto cargo and fuelers and other support aircraft. A little over an hour after the go call the first aircraft took off headed for Lyras. <br>The bomber crews were going through final briefings and targeting information. The bombers mission was to fly from their bases in the Crown to targets in northern Stevid/Greal then fly back to bases in southern Lyras.

<div class="content">The major naval conflict against Imbrinium&#8217;s fleet east of Stevidian South Greal was now beginning to linger &#8211; becoming a battle of attrition. Losses were now becoming great on both sides; carriers were now suffering damage through lack of available airpower. Stevid maintained the luxury of being able to utilise the RAF by way of additional air support as well as a larger naval contingent then their enemy. Despite this however, the Royal Navy of Imbrinium had fought gallantly and continued to do so. <br><br>The Stevidian Royal Navy had shifted the majority of its submarine and a large task force north of the combat zone to harass enemy supply convoys and close an escape north. While increasing the pressure on the enemy, it had betrayed the game plan of the Royal Navy. Imbrinium ships seemed to be heading south instead of north.<br><br>Irrespective of this, the fighting had wrought incredible damage and losses on both sides, but the objective of attacking the enemy on the occupied island and pounding the positions to the point of oblivion, had been successful. A counter invasion was off limits, but the RAF had now done enough damage to focus sorties into surgical strikes against individual ground units and formations as apposed to massed strikes against communication and C&amp;C units.<br><br>Because of this, the Royal Navy now began a fighting withdrawal from the combat zone. The RAF and Fleet Air Arm kept up the impetus and began to ignore the enemy escorts in favour of capital ships.<br><br>The Rear Admiral of the 1st Splinter Fleet of the overall Battle Fleet sent an unencrypted message to the enemy fleet in hope someone of authority remained in a position to read and hopefully act on it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;To any Commanding Officer in overall command of the fleet of the Royal Navy of Imbrinium.<br><br>This battle has been waged with extreme aggression that has cost the lives of thousands on both sides. We are willing to continue the fight, as you are. We have more aircraft at our disposal from the mainland and you are far from home&#8230; as are your air and ground forces on the island your island has occupied.<br><br>The island that I speak of has felt incredible pain and destruction at the hands of the Stevidian Royal Air Force; as such we offer these terms:<br><br>[*]An immediate cease-fire. All combat between our two fleets (including our respective air forces) will cease &#8211; however this Fleet does not speak on behalf of the Empire. The conflict between our two nations will continue unless otherwise stated.<br>[*]You will remove all of your ground forces from the island you occupied. Failure to do this will result in the final &#8216;removal&#8217; of your forces by way of our Air Force. <br>[*]By accepting the ceasefire, all our attacks against the island will cease. We will allow your forces to recover the dead and remove equipment and manpower with let or hindrance from our forces. We will not attack. <br>[*]If the previous three conditions are met we will hold the ceasefire and allow your forces to withdraw safely. Further to this, the chain of command of this fleet, including myself, will personally approach the Stevidian Government and petition it to downscale the naval force at Stevidian South Greal - the root cause of this conflict, for a previously stated the officers of this fleet do not dictate Imperial policy.<br>[*]If you do not agree to any of these terms, this fleet guarantees a 48-hour cease-fire to allow you to remove your dead from the island and to withdraw all damaged ships from the naval combat zone. Failure to grant us fellow courtesy will only invite obliteration.<br><br>God save the King.<br>God save the Empire.<br></span><br><br>The message was sent; time would tell if the enemy would find it acceptable. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">General Military Communications &amp; Intelligence Headquarters <br>(GMICHQ)</span></span><br><br>Known as &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">Gimmick HQ</span>&#8221; by the public as a play on the acronym, the massive building was situated within the city limits of the capital, and subsequently well defended by being within the walls of the fortress city.<br><br>The initial cyber attacks and direct attacks on Imbrinium and their satellite network was starting to be less tactically advantageous. The Kingdom had rerouted many of their official channels through allied networks. An easily anticipated tactic and one Stevid could not counter, but this hadn&#8217;t prevented useful information being learned before the switching had took place &#8211; and it was expected that Imbrinium would not discard their domestic military networks completely.<br><br>GMICHQ continued to utilise the advantage of battle space control, at least for as long as this advantage would last. From this the Empire had learned of potential enemy ground actions in the &#8216;pipeline&#8217; &#8211; but nothing concrete. No obvious plans or communications had been discovered. But GIMCHQ had discovered something more disturbing.<br><br>Numerous, but unconfirmed, messages and data streams suggested that missiles launched by several aircraft and/or naval shipping of the Kingdom of Imbrinium were armed with warheads loaded with chemical agents. The agent compositions and quantities were unknown but routine past intelligence reports on Imbrinium led GMICHQ analysts to believe the agents could be sarin or another type of nerve agent.<br><br>The Holy Empire&#8217;s stance on chemical weapons was well known. All chemical weapons had been banned by government decree decades ago, a policy that was surprisingly upheld by the former communist government and then further strengthened by the current one. The zero tolerance of its use in war had meant the Empire had broken alliances and diplomatic ties with nations in the past&#8230; and opposition forces that used such weapons usually felt Stevidian wrath.<br><br>Chemical weapons are indiscriminate and lethal, failing that they are certainly toxic and undoubtedly terror weapons, used against public areas and have little relevance on the field of battle seeing as most modern military CBRN drills were good enough to prevent huge loss of life. If the reports of the chemical weapon launches were accurate then the targets would almost certainly be civilian. <br><br>The Stevidian Prime Minister called an emergency meeting with all cabinet ministers, military chiefs and a handful of Cardinals and Bishops from the Church. The agreement was made to make a stand; an impressionable one that would make the Kingdom of Imbrinium sit up and re-evaluate the situation they were in.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><div align="center">* * *</div></span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">HMS Dignity</span><br>Class: Classified<br>Role: Deterrence<br>Location: Classified</span></span><br><br>Commodore Charles Penman was the CO of the <span style="font-style: italic">HMS Dignity</span>, a nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine that was patrolling an area of sea far from the fighting. Those military officials &#8216;in the know&#8217; only knew that Commodore Penman was patrolling one of the seas in the far south of the region. The exact location was not known &#8211; very few people in existence were privy to that information and the submarine&#8217;s specific mission. Its broader role was nuclear deterrence.<br><br>Penman was mulling over some documentation in his office when he was summoned to the control room by the 2IC.

The small optical tether buoy bobbing up and down on the surface 200m above the submarine began sending an receiving data on the target and confirming the authorisation codes and protocols.<br><br>Within minutes a medium range ballistic missile broke the surface of the choppy sea and engaged its main engine and careered into the sky. The missile was nuclear tipped with a maximum yield of 10 megatons but the crew had altered this to 500 kilotons for the purposes of the exercise.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Destiny Island<br>210nm NE of Tir<br>Stevidian Military Island<br>Alexander Range</span></span><br><br>The island was only inhabited by a handful of military personnel. Most were Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The island was a nuclear testing site but there had not been a test in nearly ten years. It was now used mostly as a signals relay station, but its primary role was to serve as a test area from nuclear explosions and could be used as one at a moments notice &#8211; such as now.<br><br>The palm trees at the edge of a vast sand dessert swayed side to side in the gentle breeze until, suddenly, paradise was shattered. The explosion was monumental and perfect. The detonation occurred several hundred metres above the ground and created a fireball of superheated air, plasma, dust and the raw energy that comes with bashing nuclear elements together. The fireball demanded oxygen and devoured all around it while the pressure wave expanded outwards and the subsequent shockwave knocked over everything standing upright in the ground, and brushing aside everything else.<br><br>As viewed from the observation post by the members of the military, it was a spectacle of beauty and terror. They watched as a small nearby lagoon, devoid of life from previous tests but still full of water, became superheated by the explosion close by and evaporated before their eyes. But alongside these observers were billions and billions more. Not physically present but watching nonetheless, for the event was being recorded live by several cameras both on the ground and in the air.<br><br>For those watching on television or over the Internet, the whole event last 11 minutes and was followed by an announcement on all mainstream Stevidian news networks. Few hinted at a correlation between the use of chemical weapons by Imbrinium and the use of Empire&#8217;s only variety of a WMD.<br><br>An official government declaration of the launch was seconded by the new Deputy Prime Minister and close friend of PM Conroy, Cardinal Houston of the Church &#8211; echoing the need for deterrence in times and scenarios such as these.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Morrdun, Morrdh</span><br><br>Despite being a neutral party in the ongoing conflict, the Commonwealth had been keeping a close eye on events as they unfolded such as the conflict's possible escalation with the involvement of Malgrave which raised a few concerns within the Morridane Cabinet. Even more concerning was the possible use of chemical weapons by Imbrinium and the recent detonation of an atomic weapon by Stevid. To Morridane eyes it appeared that things were on the verge of spiralling out of control, the prospect of an all-consuming and destructive conflict looming uncomfortably close.<br><br>Sooner or later the Commonwealth would have to reluctantly take action in order to ensure that the conflict didn't escalate any further, though it was stuck in an awkward position by counting both of the warring parties as allies. Going up against either of them would be an extremely difficult decision to make, though admittedly one that would be made easier if either side used WMDs. For now the Commonwealth settled upon contacting both governments via diplomatic channels and demanding reassurances that WMDs were off the table.</div>

The lead EW aircraft was a older EB-1R with the call sign of jasper the pilot was Major Guarino Sal with a long career in the EW squadrons in the RIAF, the lead bomber was a B-90 the mainline of the bomber force the pilot was Col. Vera Mancini she was a no nonsense commander, even though she was young for a colonel she had the respect of her crews. Her flight call sign is husker. <br><br>&#8220;Husker this is Jasper got multiple threats unknown inbound tangos and a possible OTH site.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Roger Jasper lead, I guess it&#8217;s time to get to work&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Roger that ma&#8217;am we are moving to intercept and do our thing, Jasper out.&#8221;<br><br>And with that jasper flight hit their afterburners and sped ahead to engage the incoming fighters.<br> <br>&#8220;Husker flight this is Husker lead makes final prep and turn on the music&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Jasper lead to Jasper flight make sure your music is on and get ready to launch decoys when we get closer.&#8221;<br><br>It would only a matter of time till the two air forces would clash over the ocean.<br> <br>As the last of the planes took off from bases in Imbrinium they were loaded with chemical and a new biological weapon that the Crown came in contact with in another region and brought it back to make a weapon out of it. The virus was packaged in a type of gel caps that would melt upon being touched by someone or will dissolve over a 12 to 24hrs in open air. The Crown picked up VBF (Varathron Blood Fever) from the outbreak in Gholgoth. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">700km north of Stevid/Southern Greal</span><br><br>The commander of Task Force Reaper both naval and marine commanders where prepping for their briefing via SVTC (Secure Video Tele Conference).<br><br>As hundreds of IAF commanders took their seats and started going over their maps and notebooks about what was about to take place.<br><br>&#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen, I&#8217;m Admiral Catone Lucchese I command this vast fleet of ours and will be controlling the support for landing operations. Here is the breakdown of operations.<br><br>D-12hrs last recon and air superiority operations, and sea suppression.<br><br>D-8hrs the final Go or No go order.<br><br>D-6hrs Prep the beaches and landing areas for sea and air.<br><br>D-4hrs Move forces into place for landing operations.<br><br>D-2hrs debarking of troops and equipment and final preps before zero hour.<br><br>D+0hrs LST and landing craft, move to the beaches along with AALVs and ELVs move to shore with first wave.<br><br>D+1hrs Beach head secure, clearing operations underway front lines should be at LOD Ashley.<br><br>D+2hrs Firsts armored battalion on land and second wave inbound.<br><br>D+4hrs Causeway started and airmobile operations begin.<br><br>D+8hrs Causeway in place supply and support operations to begin, front pushed in to phase line Brandi<br><br>D+12hrs At least three divisions on the front with armored support, a division an hour should be achievable by this time.<br><br>D+1 the frontlines should have moved through phase line Nicole, and Audree, and should be approaching phase line Arren.<br> <br>That is the first 24 to 36hrs of operations. I will like to introduce the Ground commander Field Marshall Ernesto Padovesi.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Our object is the northern port city of Vannderburg do its deep water port.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen I&#8217;m Field Marshall Padovesi, this landing operation will be the largest under fire landing this military has ever completed, I say completed cause we will not fail we will not be driven back into the sea and we will complete our mission, we cannot stop once we make land fall because as soon as the first wave hits the beach the second wave will be on their way and then the third and so on so do your job not for me, do it for the crown and your country.&#8221;<br><br>At the many CICs throughout the fleet they where locking on to ship and land targets all down the coast. With thousands of aircraft being prepped for the largest carrier strike missions in the navy&#8217;s history. The plan was to knock out or destroy every port and ship down the eastern coast of southern Greal. <br><br>The flight CAP was heavy covering the thousands of ships in the fleet, with more on the way after the first landing to move inland, C2 aircraft and ELINT aircraft where aloft gathering intelligence on the battlespace. Then the order came from the Flagship to commit to operation tempest, and with that call strike aircraft started taking off for their targets as thousands of missiles reached into the night sky headed for their end. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">200miles South of Malgrave </span><br><br>With the orders for chemical weapons release given the missiles where launch toward the capital and coast of Malgrave to suppress the incoming missiles to buy some time for the fleet. Task force Rhino&#8217;s command ship received an uncoded message from the Stevid naval fleet. The admiral read over the message and forwards it to FLTHQ in Imbrinium, and awaited a responds.<br>Minutes later the Admiral was called into a SVTC with FLTHQ.<br><br>&#8220;Admiral Artemio Boni we here at FLTCMD cannot ask you to give up the fleet or stay in the battle we are monitoring the operation but you and only have to make the decision on the outcome of this battle&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Aye Sir&#8221;<br><br>The admiral sat down at the table in the SVTC room and looked at the display of the fleets and thinking of what to do. Then he picked up the phone to communications.<br><br>&#8220;Patch me through to the Mako fleet commander&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Aye Sir&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes admiral this is Commander Gioele Angelo of the Mako fleet&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Ah Cmdr Angelo this Admiral Boni, I knew your father great sailor he was, enough with the past my friend how are things going on Mako?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes thank you sir he was a great man and is missed by all, the operational with drawn is complete of all major forces from Mako except two hospital ships and four OPVs to support them. Everything else is headed north toward Lyran waters.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What about the equipment left on Mako?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;All destroyed sir billions of Brins worth all gone.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Ok I see safe journey home my son.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Aye sir you too&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Commutations get me the fleet commanders and put them on SVTC&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Aye Sir&#8221;<br><br>Within minutes the commanders came up on SVTC and the admiral opened up his plan to the rest of the fleet.<br> <br>&#8220;Gentlemen I received a message from the Stevid naval commander, asking for a cease fire and I have talk to FLTCMD and to the Mako fleet, this is my plan the NAF and supporting ships will head south to safe port in USPA to make what repairs you can, My fleet and the heavy surface squadrons will turn north and engage the Stevid fleet with everything we have.&#8221;<br><br>With disbelief the commanders agreed and followed their orders, within minutes the NAF turned south with their support fleets with the ships and aircraft still hammering the Stevid fleet and Malgrave and it left the battlespace. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Inside the MOD, Cormond.</span><br>As a new warning sirens and lights started going off with the report of a nuclear missile launch from a possible Stevid submarine the first things where to find out where the missile was headed. The PM and the Crown place the Strategic forces on high alert and sent the same alerts to the SSBNs around the region. <br><br>As the track showed it was headed for Stevid&#8217;s nuclear test area the IIA informed the crown that this was a threat due to the use of WMDs on Malgrave.</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Morrdun, Morrdh</span><br><br>"The inspection team has left and New Garrack and should be arriving in Malgrave in the next few hours." Declared Sir Gedney Hill, the Morridane Foreign Secretary, to the assembled members of the Morridane Cabinet. "We should have their report in a few days time."<br><br>"If their findings back up the claim of chemical attacks then we'll be in an awkward situation." Commented Prime Minister Edmund Vermillion. "One I do not wish to be in but seems to be inevitable regardless. We'll be forced to take action and enter a conflict that none of us wanted the Commonwealth to enter."<br><br>"Yes, fate can be a harsh mistress sometimes." Sir Gedney replied dryly.<br><br>"Quite." Vermillion agreed. "Seems our course is laid out in front of us and all we can do is prepare the oncoming storm, speaking of which how are military wise?"<br><br>"We're mobilizing our reserves best we can without drawing too much attention, we're still trying to pass it off as bolstering our border defences but I don't know how much longer we'll be bale to fool people." Answered Nathan Hay, the Minister of Defence. "The spooks are working overtime with deception efforts though."<br><br>"Right, I suppose it is time for Operation Piper to be authorized and put into motion." Sighed Vermillion.

Over the time it had been here it had gathered enough info to build up a picture of maritime traffic at this port, chiefly of Imbrinium naval patrols in the area. The <span style="font-style: italic">Oceton</span>'s captain was just finishing his report when there was a knock on his cabin door and a rating called out. "Skipper, priority message from Morrdun."<br><br>"Very well, lets hear it."<br><br>"Sir." The rating nodded before reading out the message. "Code amber, await further orders."<br><br>"That all?"<br><br>"Aye skipper."<br><br>"Right, inform me at once when we received another message."<br><br>"Aye sir." The rating saluted before he left.</div>
